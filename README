- EC Lib

This wraps Blizzard driverlib and implements the EC chip interface defined
by Google. See below diagram for architecture.

Build Options
=============

NOTE: see include/config.h for the current list.  The information
below will be moved there over time.

- CONFIG_WATCHDOG_HELP

	Try to detect a watchdog that is about to fire, and print a trace.
	This is needed on STM32, where the independent watchdog has no early
	warning feature and the windowed watchdog has a very short period.

- CONFIG_PANIC_HELP

	Report extra information about a panic, such as the fault address,
	here shown as bfar. This shows the reason for the fault and may help
	to determine the cause.

	=== EXCEPTION: 03 ====== xPSR: 01000000 ===========
	r0 :0000000b r1 :00000047 r2 :60000000 r3 :200013dd
	r4 :00000000 r5 :080053f4 r6 :200013d0 r7 :00000002
	r8 :00000000 r9 :200013de r10:00000000 r11:00000000
	r12:00000000 sp :200009a0 lr :08002b85 pc :08003a8a
	Precise data bus error, Forced hard fault, Vector catch, bfar = 60000000
	mmfs = 00008200, shcsr = 00000000, hfsr = 40000000, dfsr = 00000008

- CONFIG_ASSERT_HELP

	Report assertion failures in a vebose manner to aid debugging. When
	enabled an ASSERT() which fails will produce message in the form:

		ASSERTION FAILURE '<expr>' in function() at file:line

- CONFIG_AC_POWER_STATUS

	Monitor the state of the AC power input and drive out a GPIO to
	the AP indicating this state. The GPIO will be driven low when
	AC power is not connected, and high when it is connected. This
	uses GPIO_AC_STATUS for this purpose.

- CONFIG_KEYBOARD_TEST

	Turn on keyboard testing functionality. This enables a message which
	received a list of keyscan events from the AP and processes them.
	This will cause keypresses to appear on the AP through the same
	mechanism as a normal keyboard press.
