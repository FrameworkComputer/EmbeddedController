This folder is for the baseboard for the board specific files which use Intel
Reference Validation Platform (RVP) for developing the EC and other peripherals
which can be hooked on EC or RVP.

This baseboard follows the Intel Modular Embedded Controller Card (MECC)
specification for pinout and these pin definitions remain same on all the RVPs.
Chrome MECC spec is standardized for Icelake and successor RVPs hence this
baseboard code is applicable to Icelake and its successors only.

Following hardware features are supported on MECC header by RVP and can be
validated by software by MECC.

## MECC version 1.0 features

1.  Power to MECC is provided by RVP (battery + DC Jack + Type C)
2.  Power control pins for Intel SOC are added
3.  Servo V2 header need to be added by MECC
4.  Google H1 chip need to be added by MECC (optional for EC vendors)
5.  4 Type-C port support (SRC/SNK/MUX/Rerimer) as Add In Card (AIC) on
    RVP
6.  Optional 2 Type-C port routed to MECC for integrated TCPC support
7.  6 I2C Channels
8.  2 SMLINK Channels
9.  2 I3C channels
