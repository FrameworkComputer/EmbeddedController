/*
 * Battery info for all quackingstick battery types. Note that the fields
 * start_charging_min/max and charging_min/max are not used for the charger.
 * The effective temperature limits are given by discharging_min/max_c.
 *
 * Fuel Gauge (FG) parameters which are used for determining if the battery
 * is connected, the appropriate ship mode (battery cutoff) command, and the
 * charge/discharge FETs status.
 *
 * Ship mode (battery cutoff) requires 2 writes to the appropriate smart battery
 * register. For some batteries, the charge/discharge FET bits are set when
 * charging/discharging is active, in other types, these bits set mean that
 * charging/discharging is disabled. Therefore, in addition to the mask for
 * these bits, a disconnect value must be specified. Note that for TI fuel
 * gauge, the charge/discharge FET status is found in Operation Status (0x54),
 * but a read of Manufacturer Access (0x00) will return the lower 16 bits of
 * Operation status which contains the FET status bits.
 *
 * The assumption for battery types supported is that the charge/discharge FET
 * status can be read with a sb_read() command and therefore, only the register
 * address, mask, and disconnect value need to be provided.
