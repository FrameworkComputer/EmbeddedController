/* Persistence module for emulator */

/* This provides storage that can be opened, closed and reopened by the
 * current process at will, whose naming even remains stable across multiple
 * invocations of the same executable, while providing a unique name for
 * each executable (as determined by path) that uses these routines.
 *
 * Useful when semi-permanent storage is required even with many
 * similar processes running in parallel (e.g. in a highly parallel
 * test suite run.
 *
 * mkstemp and friends don't provide these properties which is why we have
 * this homegrown implementation of something similar-yet-different.

/* The longest path in a chroot seems to be about 280 characters (as of
 * April 2021) so define a cut-off instead of just hoping for the best:
 * If we were to run into a path that is nearly PATH_MAX bytes long,
 * file names could end up being reused inadvertedly because the various
 * snprintf calls would cut off the trailing characters, so the "tag" (and
 * maybe more) is gone even though it only exists for differentiation.
 *
 * Instead bail out if we encounter a path (to an executable using these
 * routines) that is longer than we expect.
 *
 * Round up for some spare room because why not?
