 * Memory mapping for STM32G431xb. The STM32G431xb is a category 2 device within
 * the STM32G4 chip family. Category 2 devices have either 32, 64, or 128 kB of
 * internal flash. The 'xB' indicates 128 kB of internal flash.
 *
 * STM32G431x is a single bank only device consisting of 64 pages of 2 kB
 * each. It supports both a mass erase or page erase feature. Note that
 * CONFIG_FLASH_BANK_SIZE is consistent with page size as defined in RM0440 TRM
 * for the STM32G4 chip family. The minimum erase size is 1 page.
 *
 * The minimum write size for STM32G4 is 8 bytes. Cros-EC does not support
 * PSTATE in single bank memories with a write size > 4 bytes.
