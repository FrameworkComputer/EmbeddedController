 * TODO(crosbug.com/p/23805): Technically we can write in word-mode (4 bytes at
 * a time), but that's really slow, and older host interfaces which can't ask
 * about the ideal size would then end up writing in that mode instead of the
 * faster page mode.  So lie about the write size for now.  Once all software
 * (flashrom, u-boot, ectool) which cares has been updated to know about ver.1
 * of EC_CMD_GET_FLASH_INFO, we can remove this workaround.
