 * Construct a USART RX instance for DMA using the given DMA channel.
 *
 * This macro creates a new usart_rx_dma struct, complete with in RAM state,
 * the contained usart_rx struct can be used in initializing a usart_config
 * struct.
 *
 * CHANNEL is the DMA channel to be used for reception.  This must be a valid
 * DMA channel for the USART peripheral and any alternate channel mappings must
 * be handled by the board specific code.
 *
 * FIFO_SIZE is the number of bytes (which does not need to be a power of two)
 * to use for the DMA circular buffer.  This buffer must be large enough to
 * hide the worst case interrupt latency the system will encounter.  The DMA
 * RX driver adds to the output of the usart_info command a high water mark
 * of how many bytes were transferred out of this FIFO on any one interrupt.
 * This value can be used to correctly size the FIFO by setting the FIFO_SIZE
 * to something large, stress test the USART, and run usart_info.  After a
 * reasonable stress test the "DMA RX max_bytes" value will be a reasonable
 * size for the FIFO (perhaps +10% for safety).
