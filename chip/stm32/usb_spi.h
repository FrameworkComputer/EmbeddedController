/*
 * This SPI flash programming interface is designed to talk to a Chromium OS
 * device over a Raiden USB connection.
 *
 * USB SPI Version 2:
 *
 *     USB SPI version 2 adds support for larger SPI transfers and reduces the
 *     number of USB packets transferred. This improves performance when
 *     writing or reading large chunks of memory from a device. A packet ID
 *     field is used to distinguish the different packet types. Additional
 *     packets have been included to query the device for its configuration
 *     allowing the interface to be used on platforms with different SPI
 *     limitations. It includes validation and a packet to recover from the
 *     situations where USB packets are lost.
 *
 *     The USB SPI hosts which support packet version 2 are backwards compatible
 *     and use the bInterfaceProtocol field to identify which type of target
 *     they are connected to.
 *
 *
 * Example: USB SPI request with 128 byte write and 0 byte read.
 *
 *      Packet #1 Host to Device:
 *           packet id   = USB_SPI_PKT_ID_CMD_TRANSFER_START
 *           write count = 128
 *           read count  = 0
 *           payload     = First 58 bytes from the write buffer,
 *                            starting at byte 0 in the buffer
 *           packet size = 64 bytes
 *
 *      Packet #2 Host to Device:
 *           packet id   = USB_SPI_PKT_ID_CMD_TRANSFER_CONTINUE
 *           data index  = 58
 *           payload     = Next 60 bytes from the write buffer,
 *                           starting at byte 58 in the buffer
 *           packet size = 64 bytes
 *
 *      Packet #3 Host to Device:
 *           packet id   = USB_SPI_PKT_ID_CMD_TRANSFER_CONTINUE
 *           data index  = 118
 *           payload     = Next 10 bytes from the write buffer,
 *                           starting at byte 118 in the buffer
 *           packet size = 14 bytes
 *
 *      Packet #4 Device to Host:
 *           packet id   = USB_SPI_PKT_ID_RSP_TRANSFER_START
 *           status code = status code from device
 *           payload     = 0 bytes
 *           packet size = 4 bytes
 *
 * Example: USB SPI request with 2 byte write and 100 byte read.
 *
 *      Packet #1 Host to Device:
 *           packet id   = USB_SPI_PKT_ID_CMD_TRANSFER_START
 *           write count = 2
 *           read count  = 100
 *           payload     = The 2 byte write buffer
 *           packet size = 8 bytes
 *
 *      Packet #2 Device to Host:
 *           packet id   = USB_SPI_PKT_ID_RSP_TRANSFER_START
 *           status code = status code from device
 *           payload     = First 60 bytes from the read buffer,
 *                            starting at byte 0 in the buffer
 *           packet size = 64 bytes
 *
 *      Packet #3 Device to Host:
 *           packet id   = USB_SPI_PKT_ID_RSP_TRANSFER_CONTINUE
 *           data index  = 60
 *           payload     = Next 40 bytes from the read buffer,
 *                           starting at byte 60 in the buffer
 *           packet size = 44 bytes
 *
 *
 * Message Packets:
 *
 * Command Start Packet (Host to Device):
 *
 *      Start of the USB SPI command, contains the number of bytes to write
 *      and read on SPI and up to the first 58 bytes of write payload.
 *      Longer writes will use the continue packets with packet id
 *      USB_SPI_PKT_ID_CMD_TRANSFER_CONTINUE to transmit the remaining data.
 *
 *     +----------------+------------------+-----------------+---------------+
 *     | packet id : 2B | write count : 2B | read count : 2B | w.p. : <= 58B |
 *     +----------------+------------------+-----------------+---------------+
 *
 *     packet id:     2 byte enum defined by packet_id_type
 *                    Valid values packet id = USB_SPI_PKT_ID_CMD_TRANSFER_START
 *
 *     write count:   2 byte, zero based count of bytes to write
 *
 *     read count:    2 byte, zero based count of bytes to read
 *                    UINT16_MAX indicates full duplex mode with a read count
 *                    equal to the write count.
 *
 *     write payload: Up to 58 bytes of data to write to SPI, the total
 *                    length of all TX packets must match write count.
 *                    Due to data alignment constraints, this must be an
 *                    even number of bytes unless this is the final packet.
 *
 *
 * Response Start Packet (Device to Host):
 *
 *      Start of the USB SPI response, contains the status code and up to
 *      the first 60 bytes of read payload. Longer reads will use the
 *      continue packets with packet id USB_SPI_PKT_ID_RSP_TRANSFER_CONTINUE
 *      to transmit the remaining data.
 *
 *     +----------------+------------------+-----------------------+
 *     | packet id : 2B | status code : 2B | read payload : <= 60B |
 *     +----------------+------------------+-----------------------+
 *
 *     packet id:     2 byte enum defined by packet_id_type
 *                    Valid values packet id = USB_SPI_PKT_ID_RSP_TRANSFER_START
 *
 *     status code: 2 byte status code
 *         0x0000: Success
 *         0x0001: SPI timeout
 *         0x0002: Busy, try again
 *             This can happen if someone else has acquired the shared memory
 *             buffer that the SPI driver uses as /dev/null
 *         0x0003: Write count invalid. The byte limit is platform specific
 *             and is set during the configure USB SPI response.
 *         0x0004: Read count invalid. The byte limit is platform specific
 *             and is set during the configure USB SPI response.
 *         0x0005: The SPI bridge is disabled.
 *         0x0006: The RX continue packet's data index is invalid. This
 *             can indicate a USB transfer failure to the device.
 *         0x0007: The RX endpoint has received more data than write count.
 *             This can indicate a USB transfer failure to the device.
 *         0x0008: An unexpected packet arrived that the device could not
 *             process.
 *         0x0009: The device does not support full duplex mode.
 *         0x8000: Unknown error mask
 *             The bottom 15 bits will contain the bottom 15 bits from the EC
 *             error code.
 *
 *     read payload: Up to 60 bytes of data read from SPI, the total
 *                   length of all RX packets must match read count
 *                   unless an error status was returned. Due to data
 *                   alignment constraints, this must be a even number
 *                   of bytes unless this is the final packet.
 *
 *
 * Continue Packet (Bidirectional):
 *
 *      Continuation packet for the writes and read buffers. Both packets
 *      follow the same format, a data index counts the number of bytes
 *      previously transferred in the USB SPI transfer and a payload of bytes.
 *
 *     +----------------+-----------------+-------------------------------+
 *     | packet id : 2B | data index : 2B | write / read payload : <= 60B |
 *     +----------------+-----------------+-------------------------------+
 *
 *     packet id:     2 byte enum defined by packet_id_type
 *                    The packet id has 2 values depending on direction:
 *                    packet id = USB_SPI_PKT_ID_CMD_TRANSFER_CONTINUE
 *                    indicates the packet is being transmitted from the host
 *                    to the device and contains SPI write payload.
 *                    packet id = USB_SPI_PKT_ID_RSP_TRANSFER_CONTINUE
 *                    indicates the packet is being transmitted from the device
 *                    to the host and contains SPI read payload.
 *
 *     data index:    The data index indicates the number of bytes in the
 *                    read or write buffers that have already been transmitted.
 *                    It is used to validate that no packets have been dropped
 *                    and that the prior packets have been correctly decoded.
 *                    This value corresponds to the offset bytes in the buffer
 *                    to start copying the payload into.
 *
 *     read and write payload:
 *                    Contains up to 60 bytes of payload data to transfer to
 *                    the SPI write buffer or from the SPI read buffer.
 *
 *
 * Command Get Configuration Packet (Host to Device):
 *
 *      Query the device to request it's USB SPI configuration indicating
 *      the number of bytes it can write and read.

 *                        the device can write to SPI in one transaction.
 *
 *     max read count:    2 byte count of the maximum number of bytes
 *                        the device can read from SPI in one transaction.

 *                        BIT(1:15): Reserved for future use
 *
 * Command Restart Response Packet (Host to Device):
 *
 *      Command to restart the response transfer from the device. This enables

 *      without restarting the SPI transfer.
