# Common Mocks

This directory holds mock implementations for use in fuzzers and tests.

Each mock is given some friendly build name, like ROLLBACK or FP_SENSOR. This
name is defined in [common/mock/build.mk](build.mk) and referenced from unit
tests and fuzzers' `.mocklist` file.

## Creating a new mock

*   Add the mock source to [common/mock](/common/mock) and the optional header
    file to [include/mock](/include/mock). Header files are only necessary if
    you want to expose additional [mock control](#mock-controls)
    functions/variables. See the [Design Patterns](#design-patterns) section for
    more detail on design patterns.
*   Add a new entry in [common/mock/build.mk](build.mk) that is conditioned on
    your mock's name.

If a unit test or fuzzer requests this mock, the build system will set the
variable `HAS_MOCK_<BUILD_NAME>` to `y` at build time. This variable is used to
conditionally include the mock source in [common/mock/build.mk](build.mk).

Example line from [common/mock/build.mk](build.mk):

```make
# Mocks
mock-$(HAS_MOCK_ROLLBACK) += mock/rollback_mock.o
```

## Using a mock

Unit tests and fuzzers can request a particular mock by adding an entry to their
`.mocklist` file. The mocklist file is similar to a `.tasklist` file, where it
is named according to the test/fuzz's name followed by `.mocklist`, like
`fpsensor.mocklist`. The mocklist file is optional, so you may need to create
one.

Example `.mocklist`:

```c
/* Copyright 2019 The ChromiumOS Authors
 * Use of this source code is governed by a BSD-style license that can be
 * found in the LICENSE file.
 */

 #define CONFIG_TEST_MOCK_LIST \
    MOCK(ROLLBACK)             \
    MOCK(FP_SENSOR)
```

If you need additional [mock control](#mock-controls) functionality, you may
need to include the mock's header file, which is prepended with `mock/` in the
include line.

For example, to control the return values of the rollback mock:

```c
#include "mock/rollback_mock.h"

void yourfunction() {
    mock_ctrl_rollback.get_secret_fail = true;
}
```

## Mock Controls

Mocks can change their behavior by exposing "mock controls".

We do this, most commonly, by exposing an additional global struct per mock that
acts as the settings for the mock implementation. The mock user can then modify
fields of the struct to change the mock's behavior. For example, the
`fp_sensor_init_return` field may control what value the mocked `fp_sensor_init`
function returns.

The declaration for these controls are specified in the mock's header file,
which resides in [include/mock](/include/mock).

## Design Patterns

*   When creating mock controls, consider placing all your mock parameters in
    one externally facing struct, like in
    [fp_sensor_mock.h](/include/mock/fp_sensor_mock.h). The primary reason for
    this is to allow the mock to be easily used by a fuzzer (write random bytes
    into the struct with memcpy).
*   When following the above pattern, please provide a macro for resetting
    default values for this struct, like in
    [fp_sensor_mock.h](/include/mock/fp_sensor_mock.h). This allows unit tests
    to quickly reset the mock state/parameters before each unrelated unit test.
