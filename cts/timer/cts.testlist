/*
 * Test timer accuracy
 *
 * After sync, DUT and TH start counting down one second. After one second,
 * DUT raises GPIO level, which triggers an interrupt on TH. TH determines
 * whether the test passes or not based on how much more or less time elapsed
 * than one second.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - Sync connection
 * - GPIO_OUTPUT connection for sending notification from DUT
 * - Calibrated TH timer
