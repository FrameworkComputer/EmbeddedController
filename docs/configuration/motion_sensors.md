# Configure Motion Sensors

EC sensors are used for the following capabilities:

- Accelerometers in base and lid measure lid angle to toggle between laptop and
  tablet modes.
- Ambient light sensors control display backlight level.
- All sensor types, including gyroscope, e-compass, and pressure, are used by
  Android apps.
- Special sync sensor type, synchronizes sensor events with AP.
