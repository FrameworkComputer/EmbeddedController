# Configure Motion Sensors

EC sensors are used for the following capabilities:

-   Accelerometers in base and lid measure lid angle to toggle between laptop
    and tablet modes.
-   Ambient light sensors control display backlight level.
-   All sensor types, including gyroscope, e-compass, and pressure, are used by
    Android apps.
-   Special sync sensor type, synchronizes sensor events with AP.

*TODO* - there is good content available in the most recent [Chrome EC] overview
presentation that can be added here.
