## Software

The main source code for fingerprint sensor functionality lives in the
[`common/fpsensor`] directory. The driver code for specific sensors lives in the
[`driver/fingerprint`] directory.

## Hardware {#hardware}

The following "boards" (specified by the `BOARD` environment variable when
building the EC code) are for fingerprint:

MCU                      | Sensor     | Firmware (EC "board")                          | Dev Board                                    | Nucleo Board
------------------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------
[STM32H743] \(Cortex-M7) | [FPC 1145] | `dartmonkey`<br>(aka `nocturne_fp`, `nami_fp`) | [Icetower v0.2] <br>(Previously Dragontalon) | [Nucleo H743ZI2]
[STM32F412] \(Cortex-M4) | [FPC 1025] | `bloonchipper`<br>(aka `hatch_fp`)             | [Dragonclaw v0.3]                            | [Nucleo F412ZG]

RAM and Flash details for each board are in the [Fingerprint MCU RAM and Flash]
document.

### Sensor Template Sizes

Sensor     | Fingerprint Template Size
---------- | --------------------------------
[FPC 1145] | [~48 KB][FPC 1145 Template Size]
[FPC 1025] | [~5 KB][FPC 1025 Template Size]

### Determining Hardware {#chromeos-config-fingerprint}

If you have access to a shell on your Chromebook, you can use [ChromeOS Config]
to determine the FPMCU that it contains:

```bash
(dut) $ cros_config /fingerprint board
```

Alternatively, if you have a Chromium OS build, you can use [ChromeOS Config] in
the chroot to determine the FPMCU:

```bash
(chroot) $  cros_config_host -c /build/<BOARD>/usr/share/chromeos-config/yaml/config.yaml -m <MODEL> get /fingerprint board
```

<!-- mdformat off(b/139308852) -->
*** note
**NOTE**: If you get an empty response when running these commands, the
[ChromeOS Config] properties for fingerprint may not have been set up yet. See
the [section on updating ChromeOS Config](#update-chromeos-config).

## Building FPMCU Firmware Locally

### See `Makefile` target options

```bash
(chroot) ~/trunk/src/platform/ec $ make help
```

### Build

Replace `<BOARD_NAME>` in the command below with the fingerprint MCU that you
are targeting (e.g., `nocturne_fp`, `dartmonkey`, `bloonchipper`).

```bash
(chroot) ~/trunk/src/platform/ec $ make BOARD=<BOARD_NAME> -j
```

### Verbose Build output

Use `V=1` to see the complete compiler output (all flags).

```bash
(chroot) ~/trunk/src/platform/ec $ make V=1 BOARD=nocturne_fp -j
```

## Building all EC firmware (before "repo upload")

Before uploading a change to Gerrit via `repo upload`, you'll need to build
*all* the boards in the EC codebase to make sure your changes do not break any
others.

<!-- mdformat off(b/139308852) -->
*** note
NOTE: If you forget to do this, do not worry. `repo upload` will warn you and
prevent you from uploading.
***
<!-- mdformat on -->

```bash
(chroot) ~/trunk/src/platform/ec $ make buildall -j
```

## Building and running unit tests

See the [Unit Tests] documentation for details on how to [run the unit tests].

## Build ectool

```bash
(chroot) ~/trunk/src/platform/ec $ make BOARD=nocturne_fp utils-host -j
```

## Build and run the `host_command` fuzz test

<!-- mdformat off(b/139308852) -->
*** note
NOTE: For more details on fuzzing, see [Fuzz Testing in ChromeOS].
***
<!-- mdformat on -->

```bash
(chroot) ~/trunk/src/platform/ec $ make run-host_command_fuzz
```

## Logs

[`timberslide`] is a simple daemon that collects logs from the FPMCU and writes
them to disk. [`timberslide`] reads from sysfs, where the kernel driver
[periodically dumps the FPMCU console output][cros_ec_debugfs]. [`timberslide`]
writes the resulting logs to `/var/log/cros_fp.log`. There are multiple
instances of [`timberslide`] that run; one for each MCU running the EC codebase.

### Starting timberslide

```bash
(dut)$ start timberslide LOG_PATH=/sys/kernel/debug/cros_fp/console_log
```

### Stopping timberslide

```bash
(dut)$ stop timberslide LOG_PATH=/sys/kernel/debug/cros_fp/console_log
```

### Manually running timberslide

```bash
(dut)$ timberslide --device_log=/sys/kernel/debug/cros_fp/console_log
```

### Reading logs from kernel

If [`timberslide`] is not running you can just `cat` the logs directly from the
kernel:

```bash
(dut)$ cat /sys/kernel/debug/cros_fp/console_log
```

## Production Updates (Auto-Update)

### `fp_updater.sh` and `bio_fw_updater`

<!-- mdformat off(b/139308852) -->
*** note
**NOTE**: The auto-update process requires a working version of the firmware
running on the FPMCU. See [Fingerprint Factory Requirements] for details on
flashing in the factory.
***
<!-- mdformat on -->

[`fp_updater.sh`] and [`bio_fw_updater`] are wrappers around [`flashrom`] and
require already-functioning RO firmware running on the FPMCU. It’s meant to be
used in production to update the RW firmware. `fp_updater.sh` was used prior to
M77; `bio_fw_updater` replaces it.

It's also possible to use the updater to update the RO firmware if you disable
*both* HW and SW write protect, which we use for updating development devices
that do not have write protect enabled (dogfood devices, EVT, etc.)

In production, only the RW portion of the firmware can be updated (unless the
user disables [hardware write protection]).

## Factory / RMA / Development Updates {#factory-rma-dev-updates}

### `flash_fp_mcu`

<!-- mdformat off(b/139308852) -->
*** note
**NOTE**: This tool is really just for us to use during development or during
the RMA flow (must go through finalization again in that case). We never update
RO in the field (can’t by design). See [Fingerprint Factory Requirements] for
details on flashing in the factory.
***
<!-- mdformat on -->

[`flash_fp_mcu`] enables spidev and toggles some GPIOs to put the FPMCU (STM32)
into bootloader mode. At that point it uses [`stm32mon`] to rewrite the entire
flash (both RO and RW). The FPMCU can only be put into bootloader mode when
[hardware write protection] is disabled, which means [`flash_fp_mcu`] can only
be used when [hardware write protection] is disabled.

[`flash_fp_mcu`] is available in the [Chromium OS test image].

### `stm32mon`

[`stm32mon`] is a tool used to send commands to the STM32 bootloader. We use it
for development (through [`flash_fp_mcu`]) to erase and flash the entire chip.

[`stm32mon`] is available in the [Chromium OS test image].

## Keys

The `RO` section of the fingerprint firmware contains the public portion of the
key used to sign the RW firmware. The RO firmware uses the public key to
validate the signature of the RW firmware before jumping to it. It is not
possible to update the public key stored in the RO firmware once a device has
been shipped (i.e., once [hardware write protection] is enabled).

Different keys are used to sign the firmware during development and production.
The `dev` key is used for local builds and development and is not private; it is
called `dev_key.pem` and located in the "board" directory for the given FPMCU
(e.g., [`board/nocturne_fp/dev_key.pem`]). After doing a build, the `ec.bin` in
the `build` directory (e.g., `build/nocturne_fp/ec.bin`) will be signed with the
`dev` key.

The two other types of keys are `premp` and `mp`, which stand for "pre-mass
production" and "mass production", respectively. Both the `premp` and `mp` keys
are only available to the buildbots as part of the official build. The `premp`
is typically used during bringup of new hardware to validate the signing flow of
the buildbots, while the `mp` key is used for PVT and production devices.

Switching keys is only possible when the `RO` firmware is not write protected,
since the public portion of the keypair is stored in the `RO` firmware.

### Generate Key

For testing, you can generate a new key by using the following openssl command:

```bash
openssl genrsa -3 -out board/$BOARD/dev_key.pem 3072
```

## Signing

[`futility`] is used to sign EC firmware. There’s a wrapper script around it for
signing called [`sign_official_build.sh`].

### Key ID

The output of `futility show` will show a `Public Key File` and `Signature`
section, each of which have an `ID` field. This ID lets you match the key to the
signature in case there is more than one.
[It’s just a sha1sum of the public key,][vboot_key_id] so it lets you
[uniquely identify the key being used][vb2_public_key].

If you have the key (e.g., in PEM format), you can compute the `ID` with the
`futility show` command:

```bash
(chroot) $ futility show ./path/to/key.pem
```

#### Example

If you are building the `hatch_fp` "board" on your local machine (which signs
the resulting `ec.bin` with the `dev` key, you can check the `ID` with:

```bash
(chroot)$ futility show board/hatch_fp/dev_key.pem
```

```
Private Key file:      board/hatch_fp/dev_key.pem
  Key length:          3072

### Showing Key ID (fingerprint) for running FW

[Asked on chromeos-chatty-firmware][chatty-firmware-q] about adding an EC
command to show the Key ID (fingerprint) from the RO version. This would make it
a lot easier during both development and testing.

## Power

See [Measuring Power] for instructions on how to measure power with the
fingerprint development boards. *Make sure that any debuggers are completely
disconnected.*

<!-- mdformat off(b/139308852) -->
*** note
**NOTE**: Icetower v0.1 has a hardware bug in the INA connections, so you cannot
measure the 1.8V fingerprint sensor rail. See http://b/178098140.

Additionally, before https://crrev.com/c/2689101, the sleep GPIOs were not
configured correctly, so the change needs to be cherry-picked in order to
measure releases before that point.

## ChromeOS Build (portage / ebuild)

In order to use the fingerprint sensor with a given [ChromeOS board], a few
things need to be configured for the [ChromeOS board].

### Enable biod USE flag

The biod [`USE` flag] needs to be enabled for the [ChromeOS board]. This `USE`
flag
[determines whether the `biod` daemon is built and installed][biod chromium-os].

To enable the `USE` flag, update the `make.defaults` for the [ChromeOS board].
See the [`make.defaults` for the Hatch board][hatch make.defaults] as an
example.

#### Verifying biod is installed in the rootfs

After enabling the `biod` [`USE` flag] and building the `biod` package for your
target [ChromeOS board], the `biod` binary should be in the build directory:

```bash
(chroot) $ emerge-<BOARD> biod
```

```bash
(chroot) $ ls /build/<BOARD>/usr/bin/biod
/build/<BOARD>/usr/bin/biod
```

### Update FPMCU_FIRMWARE

`FPMCU_FIRMWARE` should be set to the set of fingerprint firmware that should be
built and installed for the [ChromeOS board].

`FPMCU_FIRMWARE` is a [`USE_EXPAND` variable][`USE` flag],
[defined in the base `make.defaults`][FPMCU_FIRMWARE make.defaults].

The `biod` ebuild uses the resulting [`USE` flags] to
[determine which FPMCU release firmware to build][biod release firmware] and the
[`chromeos-firmware-fpmcu` ebuild] uses the resulting [`USE` flags] to
[determine which firmware to install][firmware ebuild] to the rootfs in
`/opt/google/biod/fw`.

Possible values for `FPMCU_FIRMWARE` can be found by looking at the
`FIRMWARE_EC_BOARD` values in the [`chromeos-fpmcu-release*` ebuilds], which
correspond to the [FPMCU hardware](#hardware).

See the [Hatch baseboard `make.defaults`] for an example.

#### Verifying FPMCU firmware is installed in the rootfs

Once you have added the `FPMCU_FIRMWARE` flag and rebuilt the
[`chromeos-firmware-fpmcu` ebuild], the firmware will show up in the the chroot:

<!-- mdformat off(b/139308852) -->
*** note
**NOTE**: This requires access to the [internal manifest].
***
<!-- mdformat on -->

```bash
(chroot) $ emerge-<BOARD> chromeos-firmware-fpmcu
```

```bash
(chroot) $ ls /build/<BOARD>/opt/google/biod/fw
bloonchipper_v2.0.2626-3c315108.bin  dartmonkey_v2.0.2887-311310808.bin
```

The above output assumes you selected the `bloonchipper` and `dartmonkey`
firmware by setting `FPMCU_FIRMWARE="bloonchipper dartmonkey"`. The actual
version numbers displayed will not necessarily match since the firmware is
constantly updated.

### Update ChromeOS Config {#update-chromeos-config}

With "unibuild", the same OS image (build) for a given [ChromeOS board] is used
across multiple devices. Often there will be some devices that have a
fingerprint sensor, some that do not, and even different sensors for the same
board.

Determining what fingerprint hardware is on a given [ChromeOS board] is thus
done at runtime, using [ChromeOS Config].

The `fingerprint` config needs to be in the `model.yaml` for the given
[ChromeOS board]. The [ChromeOS Config fingerprint] section describes the
attributes for the `fingerprint` config in more detail.

The [`ec_extras` attribute] needs to be set to the list of fingerprint firmware
that should be built as part of the build.

See the [`model.yaml` for the Hatch board][hatch model.yaml] as an example.

Instead of crafting the `model.yaml` by hand, newer boards are moving to the
[ChromeOS Project Configuration] model, where the config is generated using
[Starlark]. The common [`create_fingerprint`] function can be used across models
to configure the fingerprint settings. See the [Morphius `config.star`] for an
example of how to call `create_fingerprint`. After you modify a `config.star`
file you will need to [regenerate the config]. If you need to change many
projects (e.g., modifying [`create_fingerprint`]), you can use the [`CLFactory`]
tool.

Once you have updated the config, you can test your changes by
[running `cros_config`](#chromeos-config-fingerprint). The ChromeOS Config
documentation has a [section on testing properties] that describes this in more
detail.

### SKUs

The fingerprint sensor may only be included on certain SKUs for a given device.
The fingerprint code uses [ChromeOS Config] to determine whether a device has a
fingerprint sensor or not. For each SKU, there is an associated
[fingerprint config][ChromeOS Config fingerprint]. [ChromeOS Config] determines
the [SKU information][ChromeOS Config SKU] (and thus the
[fingerprint config][ChromeOS Config fingerprint]) from [CBI Info]. The SKU for
a given device can be found by viewing `chrome://system/#platform_identity_sku`.

## Kernel Driver

The kernel driver responsible for handling communication between the AP and
FPMCU is called [`cros_ec`] and is enabled with [`CONFIG_CROS_EC`] in the Linux
kernel. FPMCUs that are connected via SPI use [`cros_ec_spi.c`], while FPMCUs
that are connected via UART use [`cros_ec_uart.c`].
