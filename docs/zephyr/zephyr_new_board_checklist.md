# Creating a New Zephyr EC Project

[TOC]

## Overview

This document describes the high-level steps needed to create a new Zephyr EC
project for a Chromebook design.

## Intended Audience

This document is for use by software engineers working in the EC codebase. This
document and the linked documents provide a guide for creating new Zephyr EC
projects and for modifying/maintaining existing Zephyr EC projects.

## How to use this document

The following sections detail a single feature set that needs modification for
your board design. Each feature set can be implemented with a reasonably sized
change list, and can be worked on independently.

Each feature includes the following sub-tasks:

- **Kconfig Options** - This section details the `Kconfig` options relevant to
  the feature. `Kconfig` options are enabled in one of the [project
  configuration files].
- **Devicetree Nodes** - This section details the devicetree nodes and
  properties required by the feature. The [Zephyr Introduction to Devicetree]
  provides a conceptual overview of devicetree and how Zephyr uses it.
- **Board Specific Code** - When present, this section details any C code that
  your project must implement.
- **Threads** - This section details the threads created by the feature and
  provides an overview of each thread.
- **Testing and Debugging** - This section details strategies for testing the EC
  feature set and for debugging issues. This section also documents EC console
  commands related to the feature set.
- **Example** - This section walks through a complete example for configuring an
  EC feature based on existing board implementation.

## Adding a new board to zmake

Refer the [project configuration](project_config.md) documentation to add a new
board project to zmake.

## Configure EC Features

The checklist below provides an overview of EC features that you must configure
for correct operation of a Chromebook. The “Needed for Power On” column
indicates the critical features needed during board bringup. Use the
documentation link for details about the code changes required to implement each
feature.
