# Porting EC unit tests to Ztest

[TOC]

This HOWTO shows the process for porting the EC's `base32` unit test to Zephyr's
Ztest framework. All of the work is done in `src/platform/ec`.

See
[Test Framework - Zephyr Project Documentation](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/1.12.0/subsystems/test/ztest.html#quick-start-unit-testing)
for details about Zephyr's Ztest framework.

For examples of porting an EC unit test to the Ztest API, see: *

## Porting Considerations

Not every EC unit test can be ported to Ztest. This section describes cases that
are not supported and cases where caveats apply.

### EC Mocks Are Not Supported

If a test has a `$TEST.mocklist` file associated with the unit test, it is using
the EC mocking framework, which is unsupported in the Ztest framework. Ztest has
its own mocking framework which the EC does not support.

### Multiple Task Caveats

The EC unit test framework starts a single task to call `run_test`, and this
task will then call the functions for the various test cases. Some unit tests
have multiple threads of execution, which is enabled by a `$TEST.tasklist` file
associated with the unit test. The test runner task has a task ID of
`TASK_ID_TEST_RUNNER`, which can be used as an argument to any of the task
functions. See for example the
[`charge_ramp` unit test](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/HEAD/test/charge_ramp.c#81)
and the
[`host_command` unit test](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/HEAD/test/host_command.c#32)

When a unit test is ported to Ztest, `test_main` doesn't have a thread ID, so
`TASK_ID_TEST_RUNNER` is undefined. `charge_ramp` and `host_command` cannot be
ported at this time. `test_main` also cannot call any of the task functions that
must be called from a task, such as `task_wake`; these functions can pend the
calling task, but since `test_main` doesn't have a thread ID, the pend will
fail. See the
[`mutex` unit test](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/HEAD/test/mutex.c#116)
for an example.

## Determine source files being tested

Determine which C files the unit test requires by finding the test in
`test/test_config.h`:

```
#ifdef TEST_BASE32
#define CONFIG_BASE32
#endif
```

Locate the `CONFIG` item(s) in `common/build.mk`:

```
common-$(CONFIG_BASE32)+=base32.o
```

So for the `base32` test, we only need to shim `common/base32.c`.

Add the C files to `zephyr/shim/CMakeLists.txt`, in the "Shimmed modules"
section:

```
# Shimmed modules
zephyr_sources_ifdef(CONFIG_PLATFORM_EC "${PLATFORM_EC}/common/base32.c")
```

Refer to [zephyr: shim in base32.c](https://crrev.com/c/2468631).

## Create test directory

Create a new directory for the unit test in `zephyr/test/base32`.

Create `zephyr/test/base32/prj.conf` with these contents:

```
CONFIG_ZTEST=y
CONFIG_PLATFORM_EC=y
```

Create `zephyr/test/base32/CMakeLists.txt` with these contents:

```
target_sources(app PRIVATE ${PLATFORM_EC}/test/base32.c)
```

## Modify test source code

### Test cases

In the unit test, replace `run_test` with `TEST_MAIN()`. This will allow both
platform/ec tests and Ztests to share the same entry point.

Change `RUN_TEST` to `ztest_unit_test` and add the `ztest_test_suite` wrapper
plus the call to `ztest_run_test_suite`.

```c
/*
 * Define the test cases to run. We need to do this twice, once in the format
 * that Ztest uses, and again in the format the the EC test framework uses.
 * If you add a test to one of them, make sure to add it to the other.
 */
TEST_MAIN()
{
    ztest_test_suite(test_base32_lib,
                     ztest_unit_test(test_crc5),
                     ztest_unit_test(test_encode),
                     ztest_unit_test(test_decode));
    ztest_run_test_suite(test_base32_lib);
}
```

Each function that is called by `ztest_unit_test` needs to be declared using
`DECLARE_EC_TEST`. Keep the `return EC_SUCCESS;` at the end of the test
function. Note that for the EC build, `TEST_MAIN` will call `test_reset` before
running the test cases, and `test_print_result` after.

### Assert macros

Change the `TEST_ASSERT` macros to `zassert` macros. There are plans to automate
this process, but for now, it's a manual process involving some intelligent
find-and-replace.

*   `TEST_ASSERT(n)` to `zassert_true(n, NULL)`
*   `TEST_EQ(a, b, fmt)` to `zassert_equal(a, b, fmt ## ", " ## fmt, a, b)`
    *   e.g. `TEST_EQ(a, b, "%d")` becomes `zassert_equal(a, b, "%d, %d", a, b)`
*   `TEST_NE(a, b, fmt)` to `zassert_not_equal(a, b, fmt ## ", " ## fmt, a, b)`
*   `TEST_LT(a, b, fmt)` to `zassert_true(a < b, fmt ## ", " ## fmt, a, b)`
*   `TEST_LE(a, b, fmt)` to `zassert_true(a <= b, fmt ## ", " ## fmt, a, b)`
*   `TEST_GT(a, b, fmt)` to `zassert_true(a > b, fmt ## ", " ## fmt, a, b)`
*   `TEST_GE(a, b, fmt)` tp `zassert_true(a >= b, fmt ## ", " ## fmt, a, b)`
*   `TEST_BITS_SET(a, bits)` to `zassert_true(a & (int)bits == (int)bits, "%u,
    %u", a & (int)bits, (int)bits)`
*   `TEST_BITS_CLEARED(a, bits)` to `zassert_true(a & (int)bits == 0, "%u, 0", a
    & (int)bits)`
*   `TEST_ASSERT_ARRAY_EQ(s, d, n)` to `zassert_mem_equal(s, d, b, NULL)`
*   `TEST_NEAR(a, b, epsilon, fmt)` to `zassert_within(a, b, epsilon, fmt, a)`
    *   Currently, every usage of `TEST_NEAR` involves floating point values
*   `TEST_ASSERT_ABS_LESS(n, t)` to `zassert_true(abs(n) < t, "%d, %d", n, t)`
    *   Currently, every usage of `TEST_ASSERT_ANS_LESS` involves signed
        integers.

There isn't a good replacement for `TEST_ASSERT_MEMSET(d, c, n)`, but it is only
used in two tests, `printf.c` and `utils.c`. If you need this test, you'll need
to code up a loop over the `n` bytes starting at `d`, and `zassert_equal` that
each byte is equal to `c`.

Also note that some tests use constructs like `TEST_ASSERT(var == const)`, which
would have been better write as `TEST_EQ(var, const)`. These should be rewritten
to use `zassert_equal`.

Refer to
[test: Allow EC unit test to use Ztest API](https://crrev.com/c/2492527) for the
changes to the base32.c source code.

### Tasklist

For any test that has a corresponding `${TESTNAME}.tasklist`, add the file
`shimmed_test_tasks.h` in the zephyr test directory, and in that file,
`#include` the tasklist file. See [accel_cal](https://crrev.com/c/2645198) for
an example.

Add `CONFIG_HAS_TEST_TASKS=y` to the `prj.conf` file, as well as the appropriate
`CONFIG_PLATFORM_EC` defines to include or exclude code that the unit under test
uses.

## Build and run

Use `zmake` to build and run the test:

```
(cr) $ zmake -l DEBUG test test-base32
...
