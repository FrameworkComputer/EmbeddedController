Description:
	The number of open file handles for the i2c-pseudo device.

	This shows utilization of a resource whose limit is set by
	i2c-pseudo module max_adapters parameter.

	This may be greater than the number of extant pseudo adapters
	because an adapter is only created after a specific ioctl call.
