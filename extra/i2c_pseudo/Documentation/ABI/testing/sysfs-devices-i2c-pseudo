Description:
	The number of open file handles for the i2c-pseudo device.

	This shows utilization of a resource whose limit is set by
	i2c-pseudo module max_adapters parameter.

	This may be less than the number of i2c-pseudo i2c adapters
	because those are only created after a specific ioctl call.
