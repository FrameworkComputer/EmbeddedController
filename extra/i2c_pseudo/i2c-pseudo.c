 * An instance of this struct in i2cp_cmds[] array defines a command that a
 * controller process may write to the I2C pseudo character device, hereafter a
 * "write command."
 *
 * A write command consists of one or more header fields, followed optionally by
 * data.  Each header field is fully buffered before being sent to
 * header_receiver().  Data is not fully buffered, it is chunked in fixed
 * increments set by the return value of the final header_receiver() call.
 *
 * Every write command begins with its name.  The name is used both to map the
 * command to an instance of this struct, and as the first header field.
 *
 * A header field ends at either i2cp_ctrlr_end_char or
 * i2cp_ctrlr_header_sep_char, neither of which is ever included in header field
 * values passed to a callback.
 *
 * A command always ends at i2cp_ctrlr_end_char.  Anything written after that by
 * the controller is treated as a new command.
 *
 * After i2cp_ctrlr_header_sep_char the return value of header_receiver() from
 * the previous header field is used to determine whether subsequent input is
 * another header field, or data.
 *
 * Once header_receiver() has indicated that data is expected, all input until
 * i2cp_ctrlr_end_char will be handled as data, and header_receiver() will not
 * be called again for the command.
 *
 * For a given I2C pseudo controller instance there will never be more than one
 * write command in flight at once, and there will never be more than one of
 * these callbacks executing at once.  These callbacks need not do any
 * cross-thread synchronization among themselves.
 *
 * Note: Data may contain i2cp_ctrlr_header_sep_char.
 *
 * Note: There are no restrictions on the use of the null char ('\0') in either
 * header fields or data.  (If either i2cp_ctrlr_header_sep_char or
 * i2cp_ctrlr_end_char is null then the respective restrictions around those
 * characters apply as usual, of course.)  Write command implementations need
 * not use or expect null, but they must at least handle it gracefully and fail
 * without bad side effects, same as with any unexpected input.

	 * The formatter will be called repeatedly for the same data until it

	 *
	 * Upon non-positive return value, *out should not be modified.
	 *
	 * Upon non-positive return value, the formatter should have freed data
	 * with kfree().  Implicitly this means any allocations owned by *data
	 * should have been freed by the formatter as well.
	 *
	 * A negative return value indicates an error occurred and the data
	 * cannot be formatted successfully.  The error code may or may not
	 * eventually be propagated back to the I2C pseudo adapter controller.
	 *
	 * A positive return value is the number of characters/bytes to use from
	 * the *out buffer, always starting from index 0.  It should NOT include
	 * a trailing NULL character unless that character should be propagated
	 * to the I2C pseudo adapter controller!  It therefore does NOT need to
	 * be the full size of the allocated *out buffer, instead it can be
	 * less.  (The size is not needed by kfree().)
	 *
	 * The formatter owns the memory pointed to by data.  The invoking code
	 * will never mutate or free data.  Thus, upon non-positive return value
	 * from the formatter, the formatter must have already performed any
	 * reference counting decrement or memory freeing necessary to ensure
	 * data does not live beyond its final use.
	 *
	 * There will never be more than one formatter callback in flight at
	 * once for a given I2C pseudo controller.  This is true even in the
	 * face of concurrent reads by the controller.
	 *
	 * The formatter must NOT use i2cp_ctrlr_end_char in anywhere in *out
	 * (within the size range indicated by the return value; past that does
	 * not matter).  The i2cp_ctrlr_end_char will be added automatically by
	 * the caller after a zero return value (successful completion) from the
	 * formatter.
	 *
	 * The formatter must never create or return a buffer larger than
	 * I2CP_MAX_MSG_BUF_SIZE.  The formatter is encouraged to avoid that by
	 * generating and returning the output in chunks, taking advantage of
	 * the guarantee that it will be called repeatedly until  exhaustion
	 * (zero return value) or failure (negative return value).  If the
	 * formatter expects its formatted output or natural subsets of it to
	 * always fit within I2CP_MAX_MSG_BUF_SIZE, and it is called with input
	 * data not meeting that expectation, the formatter should return

/*
 * The select/poll/epoll implementation in this module is designed around these
 * controller behavior assumptions:
 *
 * - If any reader of a given controller makes use of polling, all will.
 *
 * - Upon notification of available data to read, a reader will fully consume it
 *   in a read() loop until receiving EAGAIN, EWOULDBLOCK, or EOF.
 *
 * - Only one reader need be woken upon newly available data, however it is okay
 *   if more than one are sometimes woken.
 *
 * - If more than one reader is woken, or otherwise acts in parallel, it is the
 *   responsibility of the readers to either ensure that only one at a time
 *   consumes all input until EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK, or that they properly
 *   recombine any data that was split among them.
 *
 * - All of the above applies to writers as well.
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * - If a reader does not read all available data until EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK after
 *   being woken from poll, there may be no wake event for the remaining
 *   available data, causing it to remain unread until further data becomes
 *   available and triggers another wake event.  The same applies to writers -
 *   they are only guaranteed to be woken /once/ per blocked->unblocked
 *   transition, so after being woken they should continue writing until either
 *   the controller is out of data or EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK is encountered.
 *
 * - It is strongly suggested that controller implementations have only one
 *   reader (thread) and one writer (thread), which may or may not be the same
 *   thread.  After all only one message can be active on an I2C bus at a time,
 *   and this driver implementation reflects that.  Avoiding multiple readers
 *   and multiple writers greatly simplifies controller implementation, and
 *   there is likely nothing to be gained from performing any of their work in
 *   parallel.
 *
 * - Implementation detail: Reads are effectively serialized by a per controller
 *   read lock.  From the perspective of other readers, the controller device
 *   will appear blocked, with appropriate behavior based on the O_NONBLOCK bit.
 *   THIS IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE!
 *
 * - Implementation detail: Writes are effectively serialized by a per
 *   controller write lock.  From the perspective of other writers, the
 *   controller device will appear blocked, with appropriate behavior based on
 *   the O_NONBLOCK bit.  THIS IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE!
 *
 * - Implementation detail: In the initial implementation, the only scenario
 *   where a controller will appear blocked for writes is if another write is in
 *   progress.  Thus, a single writer should never see the device blocked.  THIS
 *   IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE!  When using O_NONBLOCK, a controller should correctly
 *   handle EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK even if it has only one writer.
