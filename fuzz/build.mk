# For fuzzing targets libec.a is built from the ro objects and hides functions
# that collide with stdlib. The rw only objects are then linked against libec.a
# with stdlib support. Therefore fuzzing targets that need to call this internal
# functions should be marked "-y" or "-ro", and fuzzing targets that need stdlib
# should be marked "-rw". In other words:
#
# Does your object file need to link against the Cr50 implementations of stdlib
# functions?
#   Yes -> use <obj_name>-y
# Does your object file need to link against cstdlib?
#   Yes -> use <obj_name>-rw
# Otherwise use <obj_name>-y
