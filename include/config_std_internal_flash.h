 * - PSTATE immediately follows the RO image.
 * - RW image starts at the second half of flash.
 * - Protected region consists of the first half of flash (RO image + PSTATE).
 * - Unprotected region consists of second half of flash (RW image).

 * this layout MUST NOT include this header file, and must instead define
 * the configs below in a chip-level header file (config_flash_layout.h).
