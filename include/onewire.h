/*
 * Note that 1-wire communication is VERY latency-sensitive.  If these
 * functions are run at low priority, communication may be garbled.  However,
 * these functions are also slow enough (~1ms per call) that it's really not
 * desirable to put them at high priority.  So make sure you check the
 * confirmation code from the peripheral for any communication, and retry a few
 * times in case of failure.
