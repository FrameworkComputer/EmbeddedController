 * Power mask used by intel_x86 to check that S5 is ready.
 *
 * This driver controls RSMRST in the G3->S5 transition so this check has nearly
 * no use, but letting the common Intel code read RSMRST allows us to avoid
 * duplicating the common code (introducing a little redundancy instead).
 *
 * PP3300 monitoring is analog-only: power_handle_state enforces that it's good
 * before continuing to common_intel_x86_power_handle_state. This means we can't
 * detect dropouts on that rail, however.
 *
 * Polling analog inputs as a signal for the common code would require
 * modification to support non-power signals as inputs and incurs a minimum 12
 * microsecond time penalty on NPCX7 to do an ADC conversion. Running the ADC
 * in repetitive scan mode and enabling threshold detection on the relevant
 * channels would permit immediate readings (that might be up to 100
 * microseconds old) but is not currently supported by the ADC driver.

 * Power mask used by intel_x86 to check that S3 is ready.

 * Transition S5->S3 only involves turning on the DRAM power rails which are
 * controlled directly from the PCH, so this condition doesn't require any
 * special code, except this collection of signals is also polled in POWER_S3
 * and POWER_S0 states.
 *
 * During normal shutdown the PCH will turn off the DRAM rails before the EC
 * notices, so if this collection includes those rails a normal shutdown will be
 * treated as a power failure so the system immediately drops to G3 rather than
 * doing an orderly shutdown. This must only include those signals that are
