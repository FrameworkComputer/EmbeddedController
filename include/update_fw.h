/*
 * This file contains structures used to facilitate EC firmware updates
 * over USB (and over TPM for cr50).
 *
 * The firmware update protocol consists of two phases: connection
 * establishment and actual image transfer.
 *
 * Image transfer is done in 1K blocks. The host supplying the image
 * encapsulates blocks in PDUs by prepending a header including the flash
 * offset where the block is destined and its digest.
 *
 * The EC device responds to each PDU with a confirmation which is 1 byte
 * response. Zero value means success, non zero value is the error code
 * reported by EC.
 *
 * To establish the connection, the host sends a different PDU, which
 * contains no data and is destined to offset 0. Receiving such a PDU
 * signals the EC that the host intends to transfer a new image.
 *
 * The connection establishment response is described by the
 * first_response_pdu structure below.

 * block_base:   offset of this PDU into the flash SPI.

 * The PDUs are up to 1K bytes in size, they are fragmented into USB chunks of

 * the flash update function.

 * just as to any other block of the transfer sequence.
 *
 * It became clear that there is a need to be able to enhance the update
 * protocol, while staying backwards compatible.
 *
 * All newer protocol versions (starting with version 2) respond to the very
 * first packet with an 8 byte or larger response, where the first 4 bytes are
 * a version specific data, and the second 4 bytes - the protocol version
 * number.
 *
 * This way the host receiving of a four byte value in response to the first
 * packet is considered an indication of the target running the 'legacy'
 * protocol, version 1. Receiving of an 8 byte or longer response would
 * communicates the protocol version in the second 4 bytes.
