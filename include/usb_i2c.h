/*
 * This header file describes i2c encapsulation when communicated over USB.
 *
 * Note that current implementation assumes that there is only one instance of
 * interface of this kind per device.
 *
 * 2 forms of command are supported:
 *   - When write payload + header is larger than 64 bytes, which exceed the
 *     common USB packet (64 bytes), remaining payload should send without
 *     header.
 *
 *   - CONFIG_USB_I2C_MAX_WRITE_COUNT / CONFIG_USB_I2C_MAX_READ_COUNT have to
 *     be defined properly based on the use cases.
 *
 *   - Read less than 128 (0x80) bytes.
 *   +---------+------+----+----+---------------+
 *   | wc/port | addr | wc | rc | write payload |
 *   +---------+------+----+----+---------------+
 *   |   1B    |  1B  | 1B | 1B |  < 256 bytes  |
 *   +---------+------+----+----+---------------+
 *
 *   - Read less than 32768 (0x8000) bytes.
 *   +---------+------+----+----+-----+----------+---------------+
 *   | wc/port | addr | wc | rc | rc1 | reserved | write payload |
 *   +---------+------+----+----+----------------+---------------+
 *   |    1B   |  1B  | 1B | 1B |  1B |    1B    |  < 256 bytes  |
 *   +---------+------+----+----+----------------+---------------+
 *
 *   - Special notes for rc and rc1:
 *     If the most significant bit in rc is set (rc >= 0x80), this indicates
 *     that we want to read back more than 127 bytes, so the first byte of
 *     data contains rc1 (read count continuation), and the final read count
 *     will be (rc1 << 7) | (rc & 0x7F).
 *
 *   Fields:
 *
 *   - wc/port: 1 byte: 4 top bits are the 4 top bits of the 12 bit write
 *         counter, the 4 bottom bits are the port address, i2c interface
 *         index.
 *
 *   - addr: peripheral address, 1 byte, i2c 7-bit bus address.
 *
 *   - wc: write count, 1 byte, zero based count of bytes to write. If the
 *         indicated write count cause the payload + header exceeds 64 bytes,
 *         Following packets are expected to continue the payload without
 *         header.
 *
 *   - rc: read count, 1 byte, zero based count of bytes to read. To read more
 *         than 127 (0x7F) bytes please see the special notes above.
 *
 *   - data: payload of data to write. See wc above for more information.
 *
 *   - rc1: extended read count, 1 byte. An extended version indicates we want
 *          to read more data. While the most significant bits is set in read
 *          count (rc >= 0x80), rc1 will concatenate with rc together. See the
 *          special notes above for concatenating details.
 *
 *   - reserved: reserved byte, 1 byte.
 *
 * Response:
 *     +-------------+---+---+--------------+
 *     | status : 2B | 0 | 0 | read payload |
 *     +-------------+---+---+--------------+
 *
 *   - read payload might not fit into a single USB packets. Remaining will be
 *     transimitted witout header. Receiving side should concatenate them.
 *
 *     status: 2 byte status
 *         0x0000: Success
 *         0x0001: I2C timeout
 *         0x0002: Busy, try again
 *             This can happen if someone else has acquired the shared memory
 *             buffer that the I2C driver uses as /dev/null
 *         0x0003: Write count invalid (mismatch with merged payload)
 *         0x0004: Read count invalid (e.g. larger than available buffer)
 *         0x0005: The port specified is invalid.
 *         0x0006: The I2C interface is disabled.
 *         0x8000: Unknown error mask
 *             The bottom 15 bits will contain the bottom 15 bits from the EC
 *             error code.
 *
 *     read payload: Depends on the buffer size and implementation. Length will
 *             match requested read count
