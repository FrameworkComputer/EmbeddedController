# Key test sequence
#
# Format is <beat>[ <keys>]
#
# Note that there must be a single space between <beat> and <keys>, if present.
# The time is in units of beats, where the beat can be selected according to
# taste. A typical beat value would be 10ms, meaning that the beat counter
# will move on every 10,000us.
#
# The format of keys is a list of ascii characters, or & followed by a numeric
# ascii value, or * followed by a numeric keycode value. Spaces are ignored
# (use '*32' for space).
#
# Examples:
# abc      - press a, b and c
# a &20    - press a and space
# *58 &13  - press KEY_CAPSLOCK and return (ctrl-m)
#
# It is possible for the beat counter to move forward at a variable speed.
# Provided that keyboard repeat does not occur, this should produce the same
# result.
