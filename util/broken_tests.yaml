# If there is a test that breaks, you can exclude it here.
# A scenario is the last part of the test name. I.e.
# tests/subsys/pm/device_driver_init/pm.device_driver_init.pm_device_runtime
# becomes pm.device_driver_init.pm_device_runtime
# Example
#
# - scenarios:
#     - pm.device_driver_init
#   platforms:
#     - native_sim
#   comment: "Explain why test breaks"
