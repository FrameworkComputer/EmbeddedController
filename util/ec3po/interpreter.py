"""EC-3PO EC Interpreter

interpreter provides the interpretation layer between the EC UART and the user.
It receives commands through its command pipe, formats the commands for the EC,
and sends the command to the EC.  It also presents data from the EC to either be
displayed via the interactive console interface, or some other consumer.  It
additionally supports automatic command retrying if the EC drops a character in
a command.

    This class essentially performs all of the intepretation for the EC and the

    formation of commands for EC images which support that.

    Attributes:
      logger: A logger for this module.
      ec_uart_pty: An opened file object to the raw EC UART PTY.
      ec_uart_pty_name: A string containing the name of the raw EC UART PTY.
      cmd_pipe: A socket.socket or multiprocessing.Connection object which
        represents the Interpreter side of the command pipe.  This must be a
        bidirectional pipe.  Commands and responses will utilize this pipe.
      dbg_pipe: A socket.socket or multiprocessing.Connection object which
        represents the Interpreter side of the debug pipe. This must be a
        unidirectional pipe with write capabilities.  EC debug output will utilize
        this pipe.
      cmd_retries: An integer representing the number of attempts the console
        should retry commands if it receives an error.
      log_level: An integer representing the numeric value of the log level.
      inputs: A list of objects that the intpreter selects for reading.
        Initially, these are the EC UART and the command pipe.
      outputs: A list of objects that the interpreter selects for writing.
      ec_cmd_queue: A FIFO queue used for sending commands down to the EC UART.
      last_cmd: A string that represents the last command sent to the EC.  If an
        error is encountered, the interpreter will attempt to retry this command
        up to COMMAND_RETRIES.
      enhanced_ec: A boolean indicating if the EC image that we are currently
        communicating with is enhanced or not.  Enhanced EC images will support
        packed commands and host commands over the UART.  This defaults to False
        and is changed depending on the result of an interrogation.
      interrogating: A boolean indicating if we are in the middle of interrogating
        the EC.
      connected: A boolean indicating if the interpreter is actually connected to
        the UART and listening.
