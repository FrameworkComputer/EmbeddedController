"""This is a shim library for the ec3po transition from subprocesses to threads.

This is necessary because ec3po is split between the platform/ec/ and
third_party/hdctools/ repositories, so the transition cannot happen atomically
in one change.  See http://b/79684405 #39.

This contains only the multiprocessing objects or threading-oriented equivalents
that are actually in use by ec3po.  There is no need for further functionality,
because this shim will be deleted after the migration is complete.

TODO(b/79684405): Stop using multiprocessing.Pipe.  The
multiprocessing.Connection objects it returns serialize and deserialize objects
(via Python pickling), which is necessary for sending them between processes,
but is unnecessary overhead between threads.  This will not be a simple change,
because the ec3po Console and Interpreter classes use the underlying pipe/socket
pairs with select/poll/epoll alongside other file descriptors.  A drop-in
replacement would be non-trivial and add undesirable complexity.  The correct
solution will be to split off the polling of the pipes/queues from this module
into separate threads, so that they can be transitioned to another form of
cross-thread synchronization, e.g. directly waiting on queue.Queue.get() or a
lower-level thread synchronization primitive.

TODO(b/79684405): After this library has been updated to contain
threading-oriented equivalents to its original multiprocessing implementations,
and some reasonable amount of time has elapsed for thread-based ec3po problems
to be discovered, migrate both the platform/ec/ and third_party/hdctools/ sides
of ec3po off of this shim and then delete this file.  IMPORTANT: This should
wait until after completing the TODO above to stop using multiprocessing.Pipe!
