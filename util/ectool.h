 *
 * <beat_us> is the length of a beat in microseconds. This indicates the
 * typing speed. Typically we scan at 10ms in the EC, so the beat period
 * will typically be 1-5ms, with the scan changing only every 20-30ms at
 * most.
 * <filename> specifies a file containing keys that are depressed on each
 * beat in the following format:
 *
 *   <beat> <keys_pressed>
 *
 * <beat> is a beat number (0, 1, 2). The timestamp of this event will
 * be <start_time> + <beat> * <beat_us>.
 * <keys_pressed> is a (possibly empty) list of ASCII keys
 *
 * The key matrix is read from the fdt.
