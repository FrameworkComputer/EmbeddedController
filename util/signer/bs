This script allows to sign CR50 RW images. By default it uses ec.RW.elf and
ec.RW_B.elf in build/cr50/RW as inputs and util/signer/ec_RW-manifest-dev.json
as the manifest, and places the newly signed images into build/cr50/ec.bin.

The only outside dependency of this script is the signing utility itself,
which is expected to be available as /usr/bin/cr50-codesigner.

The utility can be installed by running 'sudo emerge cr50-utils',

The following command line options are accepted:

  b1 - generate signature for the b1 version of the H1 chip
  elves <elf1> <elf2> - sign the supplied elf files instead of the default
        ones. Handy if the builder generated files need to be signed
  help - print this message
  hex - generate hex output instead of binary (place in 0.signed.hex and
        1.signed.hex in the local directory)
  prod - sign with prod key (no debug image will be signed)

This script also allows to sign dev images for running on prod RO. To do that
invoke this script as follows:

  H1_DEVIDS='<dev id0> <dev id1>' ${progname} [other options, if any]

where <dev id0> <dev id1> are values reported by sysinfo command in the
DEV_ID: line when run on the CR50 for which the image is built.

The same values can be obtained in the lsusb command output:

  lsusb -vd 18d1:5014 | grep -i serial

note that the lsusb reported values are in hex and need to be prefixed with
0x.

Finally, this script also allows to specify the board ID fields of the RW
headers. The fields come from the evironment variable CR50_BOARD_ID, which is
required to include three colon separated fields. The first field is a four
letter board RLZ code, the second field is board id mask in hex, no 0x prefix,
and the third field - board ID flags, again, hex, no 0x prefix.

CR50_BOARD_ID='XXYY:ffffff00:ff00' ${progname} [other options, if any]

both H1_DEVIDS and CR50_BOARD_ID can be defined independently.
