config PLATFORM_EC_CHIPSET_RESET_HOOK
	bool "Provide a hook for when the AP resets"
	default y
	help
	  Enables support for the legacy HOOK_CHIPSET_RESET hook.
	  This can be used by code that needs to run before a programmatic
	  reset actually happens.  Note that these hooks don't run with a
	  cold reset, only when the AP decides to reset itself.

	  The hook is shimmed into the AP callback API, so you can
	  set up a ap_power_ev_callback with the AP_POWER_RESET
	  event to call a handler when the AP is about to be reset.

config PLATFORM_EC_CHIPSET_RESUME_INIT_HOOK
	bool "Enable chipset resume-init and suspend-complete hooks"

	  initialize/disable the SPI driver, which goes to sleep on suspend.
	  Require to initialize it first such that it can receive a host resume
	  event, that notifies the normal resume hook.
	  The legacy hooks are shimmed into the AP callback API, so
	  a ap_power_ev_callback can be set up with the events
	  AP_POWER_RESUME_INIT and AP_POWER_SUSPEND_COMPLETE to

config PLATFORM_EC_DEBUG_ASSERT
	bool "Enable assertion failures"
	default y
	help
	  Assertion failures are used to flag conditions which should not occur
	  and thus indicate the software is unable to continue execution. This
	  option can be disabled so that the assert() macro becomes a NOP. In
	  this case, execution will continue but the results are unpredictable.

	  Messages are of the form:

	  various low-level commands regardless of the system's state.

	  See here for the key combos:

	  https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/sysrq.html

	  This option enables support for sending emulated SysRq events to AP

	  extpower_interrupt configured as the handler in gpio_map.h.

config PLATFORM_EC_FLASH_CROS
	bool
	help
	  Enables access to the device's flash through a simple API. With
	  this is it possible for the EC to update its flash while running,

	  also provided.

config PLATFORM_EC_FPU
	bool "Support floating point"
	depends on FPU && CPU_CORTEX_M && !NEWLIB_LIBC
	default y
	help
	  This enables support for floating point. This is generally already
	  provided in Zephyr, but the EC side expects a few functions to be
	  available which are not available with Zephyr's minimal lib: sqrtf()
	  and fabsf(). Enabling this options defines them.

	  For now this is only supported on Cortex-M4.

config PLATFORM_EC_HOOKS

	  from being written to improve security or to find bugs.

	  It causes any code in the iram.text section to be protected when
	  system jump is disabled (see system_disable_jump()). It also stops
	  execution of the image that is not currently being executed (read-only
	  or read-write). If internal storage is used, this is achieved by not
	  allowing code execution in that area. For external storage, it
	  disallows loading any code into RAM.

config PLATFORM_EC_PANIC
	bool "Panic output"
	default y
	help
	  Enable support for collecting and reporting panic information,
	  caused by exceptions in the EC. This can be the result of a watchdog

	help
	  Allows the AP to request hashing functions from the EC.

	  Verified boot can update the EC's read/write code when it detects
	  that it is an incorrect version. It detects this by asking the EC to
	  hash itself. If the hash is incorrect, new code is write to the EC's
	  read/write area.

config PLATFORM_EC_VSTORE
	bool "Secure temporary storage for verified boot"
	default y
	help
	  Enable support for storing a block of data received from the AP so it
	  can be read back later by the AP. This is helpful since the AP may
	  reboot or resume and want the data early in its start-up before it
	  has access to SDRAM.

	  There are a fixed number of slots and each can hold a fixed amount of
	  data (EC_VSTORE_SLOT_SIZE bytes). Once a slot is written it is locked
	  and cannot be written again unless explicitly unlocked.

	  Stored data is preserved when the EC moved from RO to RW.

config PLATFORM_EC_VSTORE_SLOT_COUNT
	int "Number of slots"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_VSTORE
	default 1
	help
	  Set the number of slots available in the verified-boot store. The
	  number required depends on the AP firmware. Typically the vstore is
	  used only for recording a hash of the read-write AP firmware for
	  checking on resume. For this, one slot is enough.

menuconfig PLATFORM_EC_WATCHDOG
	bool "Watchdog"
	depends on WATCHDOG
	default y
	help
	  Enable the watchdog functionality. The watchdog timer will reboot the
	  system if the hook task (which is the lowest-priority task on the
	  system) gets starved for CPU time and isn't able to fire its
	  HOOK_TICK event.

	  Chromium EC system uses an auxiliary timer to handle the system
	  warning event. This leaves some time to the system for preparing &
	  printing the debug information. The interval between reloads of the
	  watchdog timer should be less than half of the auxiliary timer
	  (PLATFORM_EC_WATCHDOG_PERIOD_MS -
	  PLATFORM_EC_WATCHDOG_WARNING_LEADING_TIME_MS).

config PLATFORM_EC_WORKAROUND_FLASH_DOWNLOAD_API
	bool "Workaround needed for npcx9 ES1 chip"
	depends on SOC_SERIES_NPCX9
	help
	  There's a bug in the flash download API on the ES1 version of the
	  npcx9 chips that requires some workarounds. This is needed for sysjump
	  to work properly.

config PLATFORM_EC_ASSERT_CCD_MODE_ON_DTS_CONNECT
	bool "Assert CCD Mode"
	help
	  Assert CCD_MODE_ODL when a DTS debug accessory is connected to the
	  CCD USBC port. GPIO_CCD_MODE_ODL should be configured with
	  GPIO_ODR_HIGH flag.

config PLATFORM_EC_CCD_USBC_PORT_NUMBER
	int "CCD USB Port Number"
	default 0
	help
	  USB port number of the CCD enabled USBC port.

config PLATFORM_EC_HOST_COMMAND_STATUS
	bool "Return in-progress status for slow host commands"
	default y if PLATFORM_EC_HOST_INTERFACE_SHI
	help
	  When the AP is attached to the EC via a serialized bus such as I2C or
	  SPI, it needs a way to minimize the length of time an EC command will
	  tie up the bus (and the kernel driver on the AP). If this config is
	  defined, the EC may return an in-progress result code for slow
	  commands such as flash erase/write instead of stalling until the
	  command finishes processing, and the AP may then inquire the status
	  of the current command and/or the result of the previous command.

config PLATFORM_EC_AMD_SB_RMI
	bool "Enable driver for AMD SB-RMI interface"
	help
	  AMD platforms provide the Side-Band Remote Management Interface.
	  SB-RMI provides an interface for an external SMBus controller to
	  perform tasks such as managing power consumption and power limits of
	  the CPU socket.

config PLATFORM_EC_AMD_STT
	bool "Enable driver for AMD STT interface"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_AMD_SB_RMI
	help
	  AMD platforms provide the Skin Temperature Tracking (STT) interface.
	  Skin temperature management can be used to maximize the system
	  performance while keeping the skin temperature within its
	  specification. It makes use of the thermal capacitance of the system
	  to temporarily boost above the sustainable power limit, while the
	  chassis skin temperatures are below limits.

config PLATFORM_EC_MATH_UTIL
	bool "Math utility"
	default y
	help
	  Math utilities including bitmask manipulation, division rounding,
	  trigonometric function, etc.
