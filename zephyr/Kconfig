config PLATFORM_EC_RTC
	bool "Real-time clock (RTC)"
	depends on $(dt_chosen_enabled,$(CHOSEN_CROS_RTC))
	help
	  Enable support for a real-time clock. Typically this is available
	  on-chip in the EC. It provides a way to track the passage of time
	  in terms of second and minutes. Once set, and provided that it has a
	  suitable power source, it should be able to keep reasonably accurate
	  time over a period of days and weeks.

	  The starting EC clock is typically set by the AP, since it has access
	  to the outside world and can often obtain the current time when
	  desired.

config PLATFORM_EC_SHA256_SW
	bool "Compute SHA256 in software"

	  The platform switches include:
	    LID open
	    power button pressed
	    write protect disabled
	    recovery switch

          This also enables the "mmapinfo" console command to report the current

	default y
	depends on DT_HAS_CROS_EC_SWITCHCAP_GPIO_ENABLED

config PLATFORM_EC_SWITCHCAP_LN9310
	bool "LN9310 switchcap common code"
	help
	  Enable support for the LION Semiconductor LN9310 switched
	  capacitor converter.  This will export definitions for
	  ln9310_init, ln9310_interrupt, and ln9310_power_good, which

config CROS_EC_SWITCHCAP_LN9310

	default y
	depends on DT_HAS_LION_LN9310_ENABLED

	help
	  System should remain unlocked even if write protect is enabled.

	  NOTE: This should ONLY be defined during bringup, and should never be
	  defined on a shipping / released platform.

	  When defined, CBI allows ectool to reprogram all the fields.
	  Normally, it refuses to change certain fields. (e.g. board version,
	  OEM ID)

	  Also, this enables PD in RO for TCPMv2.

config PLATFORM_EC_THROTTLE_AP
	bool "CPU throttling"
	help
	  Enable throttling the CPU. When triggered this reduces the CPU's

config PLATFORM_EC_THROTTLE_AP_SINGLE_PIN
	bool "CPU throttling and interrupt detection on a single pin"
	help
	  Enable detection of throttling interrupts on the same pin used to

	help
	  Enable compilation of the EC timer module. This provides support for

config PLATFORM_EC_VBOOT_EFS2
	bool "EFS2 verified EC boot"
	default y if !SOC_POSIX
	help
	  Enables Early Firmware Selection v2 (EFS2) verified boot. When booting
	  a Chromium OS image we're actually packing both an RO image and an RW
	  image into flash. The RO image is loaded first. EFS2 runs at boot and
	  verifies the integrity of the RW image by sending a hash of the image
	  to the Google Security Chip (GSC). Once the GSC verifies the hash,
	  EFS2 calls sysjump and reboot the EC using the RW image.

config PLATFORM_EC_VBOOT_HASH
	bool "Host command: EC_CMD_VBOOT_HASH"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_HOSTCMD
	default y
	help
	  Allows the AP to request hashing functions from the EC.

	  Verified boot can update the EC's read/write code when it detects
	  that it is an incorrect version. It detects this by asking the EC to
	  hash itself. If the hash is incorrect, new code is write to the EC's
	  read/write area.

config PLATFORM_EC_CONSOLE_CMD_HASH
	bool "Console command: hash"
	default y
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_VBOOT_HASH
	help
	  Enable the 'hash' console command. Use this command to request a hash
	  recomputation of the RO or RW image.  You can also request a hash
	  computation over an arbitrary memory range.

config PLATFORM_EC_VSTORE
	bool "Secure temporary storage for verified boot"
	default y
	help
	  Enable support for storing a block of data received from the AP so it
	  can be read back later by the AP. This is helpful since the AP may
	  reboot or resume and want the data early in its start-up before it
	  has access to SDRAM.

	  There are a fixed number of slots and each can hold a fixed amount of
	  data (EC_VSTORE_SLOT_SIZE bytes). Once a slot is written it is locked
	  and cannot be written again unless explicitly unlocked.

	  Stored data is preserved when the EC moved from RO to RW.

config PLATFORM_EC_VSTORE_SLOT_COUNT
	int "Number of slots"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_VSTORE
	default 1
	help
	  Set the number of slots available in the verified-boot store. The
	  number required depends on the AP firmware. Typically the vstore is
	  used only for recording a hash of the read-write AP firmware for
	  checking on resume. For this, one slot is enough.

config PLATFORM_EC_WORKAROUND_FLASH_DOWNLOAD_API
	bool "Workaround needed for npcx9 ES1 chip"
	depends on SOC_SERIES_NPCX9

	  GPIO_ODR_HIGH flag.

config PLATFORM_EC_CCD_USBC_PORT_NUMBER

	  USB port number of the CCD enabled USBC port.

config PLATFORM_EC_HOST_COMMAND_STATUS
	bool "Return in-progress status for slow host commands"
	default y if PLATFORM_EC_HOST_INTERFACE_SHI
	help
	  When the AP is attached to the EC via a serialized bus such as I2C or
	  SPI, it needs a way to minimize the length of time an EC command will
	  tie up the bus (and the kernel driver on the AP). If this config is
	  defined, the EC may return an in-progress result code for slow
	  commands such as flash erase/write instead of stalling until the
	  command finishes processing, and the AP may then inquire the status
	  of the current command and/or the result of the previous command.

config PLATFORM_EC_AMD_SB_RMI
	bool "Enable driver for AMD SB-RMI interface"
	help
	  AMD platforms provide the Side-Band Remote Management Interface.

	  the CPU socket.

config PLATFORM_EC_AMD_STB_DUMP

	  Enable STB dumping when AP hangs during suspend/resume.

config PLATFORM_EC_AMD_STT
	bool "Enable driver for AMD STT interface"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_AMD_SB_RMI
	help
	  AMD platforms provide the Skin Temperature Tracking (STT) interface.
	  Skin temperature management can be used to maximize the system
	  performance while keeping the skin temperature within its
	  specification. It makes use of the thermal capacitance of the system
	  to temporarily boost above the sustainable power limit, while the
	  chassis skin temperatures are below limits.

config PLATFORM_EC_MATH_UTIL
