# Below is a hack to use CONFIG_ZEPHYR in platform/ec code before
# config.h has been included.  There is some tricky ordering in some
# header files that we cannot use config.h (e.g., common.h and
# compile_time_macros.h), as many board.h and config_chip.h files
# use these macros, and thus would be included by an include of
# config.h.  We work around this by initially defining CONFIG_ZEPHYR
# in Kconfig as an invisible symbol (it should always be enabled).
# Then, once config.h gets included, it subsequently gets undef'ed by
# config.h, and then redefined by config_chip.h in the Zephyr shim.

	  sent to the AP when keys are pressed and released.
