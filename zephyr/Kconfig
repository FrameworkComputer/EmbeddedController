	  milliseconds. For example:

	    waitms 100

	  waits for 100ms. Note that long waits can introduce problems since
	  it stops the EC from executing its normal tasks. For example, a
	  two-second wait can cause the EC to reset.

	default y
	help
	  Allows the AP to request hashing functions from the EC.

	  Verified boot can update the EC's read/write code when it detects
	  that it is an incorrect version. It detects this by asking the EC to
	  hash itself. If the hash is incorrect, new code is write to the EC's
	  read/write area.

config PLATFORM_EC_VSTORE
	bool "Secure temporary storage for verified boot"
	default y
	help
	  Enable support for storing a block of data received from the AP so it
	  can be read back later by the AP. This is helpful since the AP may
	  reboot or resume and want the data early in its start-up before it
	  has access to SDRAM.

	  There are a fixed number of slots and each can hold a fixed amount of
	  data (EC_VSTORE_SLOT_SIZE bytes). Once a slot is written it is locked
	  and cannot be written again unless explicitly unlocked.

	  Stored data is preserved when the EC moved from RO to RW.

config PLATFORM_EC_VSTORE_SLOT_COUNT
	int "Number of slots"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_VSTORE
	default 1
	help
	  Set the number of slots available in the verified-boot store. The
	  number required depends on the AP firmware. Typically the vstore is
	  used only for recording a hash of the read-write AP firmware for
	  checking on resume. For this, one slot is enough.
