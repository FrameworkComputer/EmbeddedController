choice PLATFORM_EC_BOARD_VERSION_SOURCE
	prompt "Select the source of the board version number"
	optional
	help
	  This allow selection of the source of the board version number
	  information. Several options are available, but BOARD_VERSION_CBI is
	  preferred for new boards, so long as the hardware supports it (i.e.
	  has an EEPROM).

config PLATFORM_EC_BOARD_VERSION_CBI
	bool "Chromium OS Board Info (CBI)"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_CBI_EEPROM
	help
	  Choose this if the board version comes from Chromium Board Info
	  within the EEPROM. This is the recommended approach and is used on
	  newer boards. The version information is written into the EEPROM as
	  part of the factory process.

config PLATFORM_EC_BOARD_VERSION_GPIO
	bool "Strapping GPIOs"
	help
	  Choose this if the board version is encoded with three GPIO signals
	  (GPIO_BOARD_VERSION1, GPIO_BOARD_VERSION2 and GPIO_BOARD_VERSION3)
	  forming the 3-digit binary number. GPIO_BOARD_VERSION1 is the LSB.
	  This provides 8 possible combinations.

	  The GPIOs should have external pull-up/pull-down resistors installed
	  at the factory to select the correct value.
