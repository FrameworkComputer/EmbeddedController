	  This is selected if the charger's support for hardware-controlled
	  charge ramping is broken. In some cases the charger has problems
	  which make it unusable and we must fall back to software-controlled
	  charge ramping.

	  This should be enabled by charger drivers which need it. It cannot
	  be set otherwise, even in prj.conf

choice PLATFORM_EC_CHARGE_RAMP_TYPE
	prompt "Select the charge-ramp method"
	optional
	help
	  Select the method used for ramping up charging of a battery. It is
	  preferred to use the hardware method if the charger chip can support
	  it. If not, software-controlled charging can be used, with a slight
	  increase in code size.

config PLATFORM_EC_CHARGE_RAMP_HW
	bool "Hardware-controlled charging"
	depends on !PLATFORM_EC_CHARGER_CHGRAMP_BROKEN
	help
	   Disables software control of ramping up charging. This is used when
	   the hardware has a mechanism for ramping input current and
	   backing-off as needed.

config PLATFORM_EC_CHARGE_RAMP_SW
	bool "Software-controlled charging"
	select HAS_TASK_CHG_RAMP
	help
	  Enables ramping up charging from an external source to the maximum
	  available within the source's limits and taking into account the
	  current needs of the device. It handles the user plugging chargers in
	  and removing them.
