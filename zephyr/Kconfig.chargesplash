	  A charger which is connecting and disconnecting frequently
	  can indicate damage to the charger or port.  To prevent
	  excessive power usage on a device plugged in and
	  experiencing frequent AC connects, we monitor the number of
	  AC connects over a period of time.  If the number of AC
	  connects exceeds a defined value during that period of time,
	  we inhibit all chargesplash requests until an entire period
	  passes with no new AC connections.

	  This config option defines the length of the period, in
	  seconds.
