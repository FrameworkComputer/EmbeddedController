config PLATFORM_EC_CONSOLE_CHANNEL
	bool "Console channels"
	depends on CONSOLE
	default y
	help
	  Make it possible for console to be output to different channels that
	  can be turned on and off. Channels are organized by functional area
	  such as "charger", "motionsense", "usbpd" and others.

	  This is useful as a developer convenience when the console is crowded
	  with messages, to make it easier to use the interactive console.

	  The `chan` console command with no arguments shows all available
	  channels.

	  FAFT and servod also use this feature.

	  Boards may #undef this to reduce image size.

# Adjusted to the account for the build_info[] string (about 160 bytes) plus
# the image type (about 16 bytes).
# printed by the banner.

	  Enable the EC_CMD_CONSOLE_SNAPSHOT and EC_CMD_CONSOLE_READ

config PLATFORM_EC_HOSTCMD_CONSOLE_BUF_SIZE
	int "Console buffer size"
	default 4096
	help
	  The EC will use a circular buffer to store bytes outputted
	  to the console for the AP to read.  This changes the maximal
	  number of bytes from the console output which can be saved.

	  Choosing a power-of-two for this value is optimal, as
	  modular arithmetic is used.

	select LOG_OUTPUT
	help
	  Enable the logging backend for the console buffer.

	  This will copy messages sent to the zephyr logging subsystem
	  to the EC console buffer. This allows the AP to access the
	  log messages with the console host command.

	help
	  The size of the temporary buffer used by the console buffer backend.
	  The logging subsystem will buffer up to this many bytes before calling
	  the backend in deferred logging mode. Ideally this will be large
	  enough to fit an entire log line.
