	  The AP communicates with the EC using one of several host interface
	  types.  The selection of the host interface type is based on the
	  capability of both the AP and the EC.

	  x86-compatible application processors typically use the enhanced SPI
	  (ESPI) interface while other application processors use the SPI host
	  interface (SHI).

config PLATFORM_EC_HOST_INTERFACE_ESPI
	bool "eSPI"
	depends on ESPI && AP
	help
	  Enable the Enhanced Serial Peripheral Interface (eSPI) host interface.
	  eSPI supports a shared physical connection between several on-board
	  devices, similar to SPI. It adds a few optional signals and a protocol
	  layer to provide independent 'channels' for each device to communicate
	  over.

	  eSPI is the replacement for LPC (Low-Pin-Count bus).

	  See here for information about eSPI:

config PLATFORM_EC_HOST_INTERFACE_HECI
	bool "HECI"
	depends on AP
	help
	  Enable the Host Embedded Controller Interface (HECI).


config PLATFORM_EC_HOST_INTERFACE_LPC
	bool "LPC"
	depends on AP
	help
	  Enable the Low-Pin-Count (LPC) bus.

config PLATFORM_EC_HOST_INTERFACE_SHI
	bool "SPI Host Interface"
	depends on AP
	help
	  Enable the SPI Host Interface (SHI). This is a traditional SPI (serial
	  peripheral interface), where the AP is the SPI controller and the EC
	  is the SPI peripheral.

config PLATFORM_EC_HOST_INTERFACE_USB
	bool "USB"
	depends on AP
	help
	  Enable the USB host interface.
