config PLATFORM_EC_I2C
	def_bool I2C
	help
	  Enable compilation of the EC i2c module. Once enabled, it will be
	  possible to make calls using the old platform/ec i2c APIs defined
	  in include/i2c.h and implemented in common/i2c_controller.c. Doing so
	  should make shimming other platform/ec modules which rely on i2c
	  communication "just work" without requiring any further code changes.

config PLATFORM_EC_I2C_DEBUG
	bool "I2C Tracing"
	help
	  This option enables I2C bus communication tracing. Use the console
	  command "i2ctrace" to enable and disable tracing on specific I2C
	  peripherals.

	  Please see the I2C debugging documentation for more details:

	  https://source.chromium.org/chromiumos/chromiumos/codesearch/+/main:src/platform/ec/docs/i2c-debugging.md

config PLATFORM_EC_I2C_PASSTHRU_RESTRICTED
	bool "Restrict I2C PASSTHRU command"
	help
	  Enables board-specific restrictions for the I2C PASSTHRU host command.
	  Once enabled, board_allow_i2c_passthru function has to be implemented,
	  which defines the allowed usage of the command.

config PLATFORM_EC_I2C_DEBUG_PASSTHRU
	bool "I2C Passthru Debug"
	help
	  This option enables extra debug for I2C passthru operations initiated
	  by the AP.

config PLATFORM_EC_CONSOLE_CMD_I2C_PORTMAP
	bool "Console command: i2c_portmap"
	default y
	help
	  Enable the 'i2c_portmap' console command. This comamnd is used to
	  display the mapping of the I2C ports defined by the named-i2c-ports
	  node to the physical port and remote port indexes.

config PLATFORM_EC_CONSOLE_CMD_I2C_SPEED
	bool "Console command: i2cspeed"
	help
	  Enable the 'i2cspeed' console command. This comamnd is used to
	  display an I2C port's bus speed. Additionally, for ports with
	  the DYNAMIC_SPEED port flag set, the speed can be set. In all
	  cases, the bus speed is in units of kHz.

config PLATFORM_EC_HOSTCMD_I2C_CONTROL
	bool "Host command: i2c_control"
	help
	  Enable the I2C_CONTROL host command. This comamnd is used to
	  display an I2C port's bus speed. Additionally, for ports with
	  the DYNAMIC_SPEED port flag set, the speed can be set. In all
	  cases, the bus speed is in units of kHz. More functionality of
	  the command may be added in the future.

config PLATFORM_EC_SMBUS_PEC
	bool "Packet error checking support for SMBus"
	help
	  If enabled, adds error checking support for i2c_readN, i2c_writeN,
	  i2c_read_string and i2c_write_block. Where
	  - write operation appends an error checking byte at end of transfer, and
	  - read operatoin verifies the correctness of error checking byte from the
	  peripheral.
	  Set I2C_FLAG on addr_flags parameter to use this feature.

	  This option also enables error checking function on smart batteries.
