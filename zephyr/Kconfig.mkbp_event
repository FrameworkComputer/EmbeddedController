      Select to send MKBP events via GPIO. You should define GPIO_EC_INT_L
      as a GPIO output from the EC. The GPIO is used to indicate an
      event is ready for serving by the AP.

config PLATFORM_EC_MKBP_USE_HOST_EVENT
    bool "Use host event"
    help
      Select to send MKBP events via host event.

config PLATFORM_EC_MKBP_USE_GPIO_AND_HOST_EVENT
    bool "Use GPIO and host event"
    help
      MKBP events are notified by using both a GPIO and a host event.

      You should use this if you are using a GPIO to notify the AP of an MKBP
      event, and you need an MKBP event to wake the AP in suspend and the
      AP cannot wake from the GPIO.  Since you are using both a GPIO and
      a hostevent for the notification, make sure that the S0 hostevent mask
      does NOT include MKBP events.  Otherwise, you will have multiple
      consumers for a single event. However, make sure to configure the
      host event *sleep* mask in coreboot to include MKBP events. In order to
      prevent all MKBP events from waking the AP, use
      CONFIG_MKBP_EVENT_WAKEUP_MASK to filter the events.

config PLATFORM_EC_MKBP_USE_CUSTOM
    bool "Use custom method"
    help
      Select to send MKBP events using custom method. You need to define
      mkbp_set_host_active_via_custom() which is called when there's a MKBP event
      to be sent. for more about the function, refer to mkbp_event.h.
