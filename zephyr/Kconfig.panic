config PLATFORM_EC_SOFTWARE_PANIC
	bool "Software panic"
	default y
	help
	  Sometimes the EC has bugs that are provoked by unexpected events.
	  This enables storing a panic log and halt the system for
	  software-related reasons, such as stack overflow or assertion
	  failure.

config PLATFORM_EC_CONSOLE_CMD_CRASH
	bool "Console command: crash"
	default y
	help
	  For testing purposes it is useful to be able to generation exceptions
	  to check that the panic reporting is working correctly. The enables
	  the 'crash' command which supports generating various exceptions,
	  selected by its parameter:

	     assert              - assertion failure (ASSERT() macro)
	     divzero             - division by zero
	     udivzero            - division of unsigned value by zero
	     stack (if enabled)  - stack overflow
	     unaligned           - unaligned access (e.g. word load from 0x123)
	     watchdog            - watchdog timer fired
	     hang                - infinite loop in the EC code

config PLATFORM_EC_STACKOVERFLOW
	bool "Console command: crash stack"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_CONSOLE_CMD_CRASH
	default y if !ZTEST && !SOC_POSIX
	help
	  This enables the 'stack' parameter for the 'crash' command. This
	  causes a stack overflow by recursing repeatedly while task switching.
	  This can be used to check that stack-overflow detection is working
	  as expected.

config PLATFORM_EC_DEBUG_ASSERT_BRIEF
	bool "Enable brief panic messages"
	default n
	help
	  On assertion failure, prints only the file name and the line number.
	  Boards typically define this option in order to reduce image size.
