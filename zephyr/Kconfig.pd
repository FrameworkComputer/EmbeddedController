menuconfig PLATFORM_EC_USB_POWER_DELIVERY
	bool "USB Type-C Power Delivery (PD)"
	default y
	help
	  USB has always provided basic power to an attached peripheral. USB-C
	  PD is part of the USB 3.0 standard and allows a lot more functionality
	  than the basic 500mA @ 5V. It allows negotiating power delivery over
	  the USB cable to select voltages up to 20V with current up to 5A.

	  This option also enables the Type-C Port Manager (TCPM) on the EC. The
	  TCPM deals with the various state changes in the system as devices are
	  plugged and unplugged, as well as changes in power requirements from
	  those devices.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_HOST_CMD
	bool "Host commands related to USB Power Delivery"
	default y
	help
	  This enables host commands which allow finding out the capabilities
	  of USB PD, checking is status and controlling how it operates. For
	  devices which support firmware update, this is provided as well,
	  with the firmware being sent from the AP.

config PLATFORM_EC_CONSOLE_CMD_MFALLOW
	bool "Console command: mfallow"
	default y
	help
	  Controls whether multi-function support is allowed for DP (Display
	  Port) connections. Default setting allows multi-function support when
	  the attached device also supports multi-function mode.

	    mfallow <port> [true | false]

config PLATFORM_EC_CONSOLE_CMD_PD
	bool "Console command: pd"
	default y
	help
	  Provides information about the current USB Power Delivery state and
	  also allows various changes to be made for testing purposes.

	  It has a number of subcommands:

	     pd dump <n>  - sets the debug level (0-3). This affects all layers
	                    of the stack
	     pd trysrc [0/1/2] - prints or sets the Try.SRC override. Use 0 to
	                    force Try.SRC off, 1 to force Try.SRC on, and 2 to
	                    let USB PD stack control the Try.SRC behavior.
	     pd version   - show PD version in use
	     pd <port> state  - show start for a PD port

	  Ssee usb_pd_console.c for full details including various commands
	  for role swap, reset, enable/disable, requesting SNK or SRC, etc.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_DEBUG_FIXED_LEVEL
	bool "USB Power Delivery debug level is fixed at build time"
	help
	  Enable this to set the debug level to a fixed value in the build.
	  This saves space but means that the level cannot be changed using
	  commands like 'pd dump'. Typically this should be set when a platform
	  is shipped.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_DEBUG_LEVEL
	int "Debug level to use"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_DEBUG_FIXED_LEVEL
	help
	  Sets the value of the debug level to use. If this is 0 then no
	  debugging output is available from the USB Power Delivery stack.
	  The meaning of each level depends on the module in question, but
	  the maximum available level is 3.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_INITIAL_DEBUG_LEVEL
	int "Initial debug level to use"
	default 1
	help
	  Sets the initial value of the debug level to use, while
	  still allowing the debug level to be changed using 'pd dump'.
	  A value of 0 will initially disable debug logging, and values 1
	  through to 3 will increase the level of debug logging.
	  If this config is not set, the default level will be set to 1.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_5V_EN_CUSTOM
	bool "Custom method of detecting VBUS"
	help
	  Enable this if your board needs a custom method to determine if VBUS
	  is enabled on a source port. You must provide an implementation of:

	     int board_is_sourcing_vbus(int port)

	  It should return 0 if not sourcing VBUS on that port and non-zero
	  if sourcing.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_5V_CHARGER_CTRL
	bool "Ask charger if VBUS is enabled on a source port"
	help
	  Enable this if the charger controls VBUS on a source port.
	  The function charger_is_sourcing_otg_power is called
	  to determine if VBUS is enabled on the source port.

config PLATFORM_EC_USBC_VCONN
	bool "Support USB Type-C VCONN"
	default y
	help
	  This enables support for USB Type-C connector voltage (VCONN). This
	  option must be enabled to communicate with electronically marked
	  (E-Mark) cables. This option is required for operation with USB4 and
	  Thunderbolt devices.

	  This is not needed for captive cables.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_DUAL_ROLE
	bool "Board can act as a dual-role Power Delivery port"
	default y
	help
	  This enables support for switching between source and sink during
	  operation. This means that the port can accept power (e.g. to charge
	  up its battery), or send out power to an attached device on the same
	  port.

menuconfig PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_DPS
	bool "Board can support Dynamic PDO Selection"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_BATTERY
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_USB_POWER_DELIVERY
	default n
	select HAS_TASK_DPS
	help
	  Enable this if the board needs dynamic PDO selection.
	  DPS picks a power efficient PDO regarding to the underlying battery
	  configuration and the system loading.
	  Default configuration can be overridden by `dps_config` to adapt
	  to each board's need.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_DUAL_ROLE_AUTO_TOGGLE
	bool "Board can use TCPC-controlled DRP toggle"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_DUAL_ROLE
	default y
	help
	  Enable this if the USB Type-C Port Controllers (TCPC) used on the
	  board supports toggling of the power role autonomously. When this is
	  disabled, the USB power delivery task is responsible for manually
	  toggling the power role.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_REV30
	bool "USB PD Rev3.0 functionality"
	default y
	help
	  Enable this to allow Rev3.0 functionality, including features such as
	  Fast Role Swap, advertising the available power across all ports of a
	  multi-port charger, and USB4. If disabled, only USB Power Delivery
	  Rev2.0 functionality is supported.

	  This defaults to y because PD Rev3.0 is required for USB4
	  functionality.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_ALT_MODE
	bool "USB Power Delivery alternate mode"
	default y
	help
	  Enable this to support USB PD alternate mode. This allows negotiation
	  of a different mode of operation to allow non-USB traffic to pass over
	  a USB Type-C link. This makes use of some or all of the USB 3.0 bus
	  differential pairs. If all are used for the alternate mode, then USB
	  transmission is not available at all while in this mode.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_REQUIRE_AP_MODE_ENTRY
	bool "USB Power delivery requires AP to enter alternate modes"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_ALT_MODE
	help
	  Do not enter USB PD alternate modes or USB4 automatically, Wait for
	  the AP to direct the EC to enter a mode. This requires AP software
	  support.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_ALT_MODE_DFP
	bool "Downward Facing Port support"
	default y
	help
	  Enable support for USB Power Delivery alternate mode of Downward
	  Facing Port.

	  TODO: Add more help here

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_ALT_MODE_UFP
	bool "Upward Facing Port support"
	help
	  Enable support for USB Power Delivery alternate mode of Upward
	  Facing Port (UFP).

	  By default, Chromium OS only enables alternate modes (Display Port,
	  USB4, Thuderbolt, etc) when the USB data role resolves to the
	  Downstream Facing Port (DFP) role. Enable this option to support
	  USB4 and ThunderBolt operation when the Chromium OS data role
	  resolves to the UFP role.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_USB32_DRD
	bool "Port is capable of operating as a USB3.2 device"
	default n
	help
	  Enable this if the board's USB Power Delivery Downward Facing Port is
	  capable of operating as both a USB Host (DFP, assumed by default) and a USB
	  Device (UFP): it is a Dual-Role Data (DRD) device.

	  This is advertised to port partners so they can potentially take advantage
	  of the additional features available.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_DP_HPD_GPIO
	bool "Hotplug Detect (HPD) is controlled by an EC GPIO"
	help
	  Enable this if the EC must send the Hotplug Detect (HPD) signal to
	  the DisplayPort Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) via a GPIO. Otherwise
	  this is sent by the display device.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_DP_HPD_GPIO_CUSTOM
	bool "Custom handling of HPD GPIO"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_DP_HPD_GPIO
	help
	  Enable this if the Hotplug Detect (HPD) GPIO level has to be handled
	  by custom functions. In this case your board must implement a
	  function to enable the feature for a port and another function to
	  check the current state:

	    void svdm_set_hpd_gpio(int port, int enable);

	    int svdm_get_hpd_gpio(int port);

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_DATA_RESET_MSG
	bool "Enable the PD Data Reset Message."
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_REV30
	help
	  Enable this to support the Data Reset PD message flows. This is
	  mandatory for products supporting USB4 but optional for other PD 3.0
	  products.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_TYPEC_SM
	bool "Type-C (TC) physical-layer state machine"
	default y
	help
	  This enables the bottom layer of the TCPMv2 state machine which
	  handles using CC lines to set the voltage-level of the power supplied.
	  You should normally define this unless you want to override it in your
	  board code, which is not recommended.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PRL_SM
	bool "Protocol layer (PRL) state machine"
	default y
	help
	  This enables the middle layer of the power-delivery (PD) protocol,
	  which deals with the flow of power messages across the USB Type-C
	  interface. You should normally define this unless you want to override
	  it in your board code, which is not recommended.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PE_SM
	bool "Policy engine (PE) state machine"
	default y
	help
	  This enables the top layer of the power-delivery (PD) protocol, which
	  deals with the actually PD messages that are exchanged with attached
	  USB devices. You should normally define this unless you want to
	  override it in your board code, which is not recommended.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_DECODE_SOP
	def_bool y  # Required for TCPMV2
	help
	  This enables support for encoding of the message's Start Of Packet
	  (SOP, SOP' and SOP'', collectively called SOP*) in bits 31-28 of the
	  32-bit msg header type.

config PLATFORM_EC_HOSTCMD_PD_CONTROL
	bool "Host command: EC_CMD_PD_CONTROL"
	default y
	help
	  Enable the EC_CMD_PD_CONTROL host command. This allows control
	  of the USB-PD chip from the AP, including reset, suspend/resume
	  and enabling power.

	  This host command can be manually executed using the
	  "ectool pdcontrol" command from the Chromium OS shell.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_LOGGING
	bool "Host command: EC_CMD_PD_GET_LOG_ENTRY"
	help
	  Enable logging of USB Power Delivery events. The AP can request the
	  log to see what has happened recently.

	  The log events are stored in a circular buffer, each one being a
	  struct event_log_entry.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_TRY_SRC
	bool "Enable Try.SRC mode"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_USB_DRP_ACC_TRYSRC
	default y
	help
	  This enables Try.SRC mode so that the board will try to be a source
	  for power if the other end offers both options. This can be useful
	  for laptops, for example, since when attaching to a cellphone we want
	  the laptop to charge the phone, not vice versa.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_USB4
	bool "USB4 support"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_REV30
	default n
	help
	  This enables support for entering into USB4 mode between two port
	  partners. The provides new features such as higher speeds and more
	  flexible multiplexing of data on the cable for different purposes,
	  e.g. attaching multiple displays and storage devices on the same bus.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_TBT_COMPAT_MODE
	bool "Thunderbolt-compatible mode support"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_REV30
	default n
	help
	  Enable this to allow entering into Thunderbolt-compatible mode between
	  two port partners. This does not require that USB4 mode be enabled.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_STARTUP_DELAY_MS
	int "PD thread startup delay time in milliseconds"
	default 0
	help
	  Have the USB-PD thread(s) delay this many milliseconds after startup
	  before beginning regular processing. This can be helpful if external
	  processes need to happen shortly after reset and PD initialization may
	  interfere with them.

	  For instance, if the EC enters programming mode when it receives a special
	  signal but requires USB-PD power in order to remain alive, PD
	  initialization can cause the system to reset and interrupt programming.
	  Adding a delay to startup can provide a wider window to enter programming
	  mode and help prevent such issues.

config PLATFORM_EC_CONFIG_USB_PD_3A_PORTS
	int "Number of USBC ports that can supply 3A"
	default 1
	help
	 Ensure that CONFIG_USB_PD_TCPMV2 is not being used with charge_manager source
	 defines, and define a default number of 3.0 A ports if not selected. Note
	 that the functionality of this default of 1 is equivalent to both previous
	 defines, which only ever allocated one 3.0 A port.

	 To turn off the TCPMv2 3.0 A current allocation from the DPM, set
	 CONFIG_USB_PD_3A_PORTS to 0.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_TEMP_SENSOR
	int "Temperature sensor used in PD messages"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_TEMP_SENSOR
	default 0
	help
	 Temperature related fields in USB PD messages assume a device only has
	 one temperature. But, Chromebooks can have multiple temperature sensors.
	 This option selects which temperature sensor is used for USB PD.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_SHORT_PRESS_MAX_MS
	int "Time limit in ms for short presses with a USB PD power button"
	default 4000
	help
	 USB PD supports power buttons over USB-C using button press and button
	 release alerts. How a chromeOS device responds depends on whether the button
	 press is considered short or long. This config is used to set the short press
	 time limit in ms. Any press shorter will be a short press and any press
	 longer will either be a long press or invalid.

config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_LONG_PRESS_MAX_MS
	int "Time limit in ms for valid presses with a USB PD power button"
	default 8000
	help
	 USB PD supports power buttons over USB-C using button press and button
	 release alerts. If a USB PD partner sends a press but never a release alert,
	 the EC should time out while waiting for the release and return to an idle
	 state. This value sets how long the EC waits for a release alert from the
	 partner in ms. Any press longer than this will not be considered a valid USB
	 PD button press.
