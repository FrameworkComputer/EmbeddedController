config PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_FRS
	bool "Support Fast Role Swap protocol"
	help
	  Enables the protocol side of Fast Role Swap (FRS). This allows the
	  device to switch from a SNK to a SRC (or vice versa) based on
	  communication with the partner device.

	  For this to work the trigger must be implemented in either the
	  Type-C Port Controller (TCPC) or Power Path Controller (PPC).

	  FRS differs from the traditional power-role swap in that FRS
	  guarantees there is no interruption of power nor disruption of data
	  communication to any downstream devices (such as devices connected
	  to a USB-C hub or dock).
