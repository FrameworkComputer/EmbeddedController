	  Enable shimming the platform/ec AP power sequencing code. This
	  handles powering the chipset on and off.

	  Enabling this automatically enables HAS_TASK_CHIPSET since power
	  sequencing must run in its own task.

	  When the AP enters C10, the power rails VCCIO, VCCSTG, and VCCPLL_OC
	  may be turned off by the board.  If the PROCHOT# signal is pulled up
	  by any of these rails, PROCHOT is not valid while the AP is in C10,
