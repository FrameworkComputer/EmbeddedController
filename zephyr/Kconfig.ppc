	default y
	help
	  Enable this to support the USB Type-C PPC on your board. This enables
	  common routines for things like figuring out whether power is being
	  supplied to the Chromebook over USB-C, whether the Chromebook is
	  supplying power to another device, etc.

config PLATFORM_EC_USBC_PPC_POLARITY
	bool
	help
	  Enable this if a Power Path Controller needs to be informed of
	  the polarity of the Configuration Channel (CC) pins. This can change
	  depending on which way up the USB-C cable is inserted into the
	  device.

	  This should be enabled by drivers which can detect this. It cannot be
	  set otherwise, even in prj.conf

config PLATFORM_EC_USBC_PPC_SBU
	bool
	help
	  Enable this if a Power Path Controller is capable of gating the
	  Sideband Use (SBU) lines. If so, the USB mux will use this feature
	  to isolate the lines before entering into alternate mode.

	  This should be enabled by drivers which can detect this. It cannot be
	  set otherwise, even in prj.conf

config PLATFORM_EC_USBC_PPC_VCONN
	bool

	help
	  Enable this if a Power Path Controller is capable of providing
	  VCONN. If so, the USB stack will enable / disable VCONN as needed.

	  This should be enabled by drivers which can detect this. It cannot be
	  set otherwise, even in prj.conf

	  Note: This may not be true, as there may be scenarios where the board
	  might need to disable this feature (for instance when both the PPC and
	  TCPC can supply VCONN). We can cross that bridge when we come to it.
