	  Intel Burnside Bridge is a Type-C multi-protocol retimer to be used
	  in on-board applications. Burnside Bridge offers the ability to latch
	  protocol signals into on-chip memory before retransmitting them
	  onwards. It can be used to extend the physical length of the system
	  without increasing high-frequency jitter.

	  Burnside Bridge supports spec compliant retimer of following
	  protocols:

	    - Display Port: four unidirectional DP lanes
	    - USB3.1 Gen1/2: one bi-directional USB lane
	    - Thunderbolt: two bi-directional CIO lanes
	    - Multifunction Display (MFD): two unidirectional lanes of DP and
