config PLATFORM_EC_CONSOLE_CMD_RTC
	bool "Console command: rtc"
	help
	  This command allows getting and setting the current RTC value. The
	  value is in seconds since the Epoch (midnight on 1/1/70). You can
	  convert this to a human date on the command line with 'date -u -d @n'
	  where n is the numeric value. To convert a time to seconds, use:

	     date -d '1970-01-01 UTC + n seconds'

config PLATFORM_EC_CONSOLE_CMD_RTC_ALARM
	bool "Console command: rtc_alarm"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_CONSOLE_CMD_RTC
	help
	  This command supports setting a real-time-clock (RTC) alarm that
	  causes an interrupt when the timer reaches that point. To set the
	  alarm:

	     rtc <sec> [<usec>]

	  where:
	    <sec> is the number of seconds since the epoch
	    <usec> is the optional number of microseconds (fractional seconds)

config PLATFORM_EC_HOSTCMD_RTC
	bool "Host command: EC_CMD_RTC_GET_VALUE etc."
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_HOSTCMD
	help
	  Enables support for EC_CMD_RTC_GET_VALUE, EC_CMD_RTC_SET_VALUE,
	  EC_CMD_RTC_GET_ALARM and EC_CMD_RTC_SET_ALARM which colectively allow
	  the AP to control the EC's real-time-clock. The AP typically makes
	  use of the EC's RTC to avoid needing a discrete RTC chip on the board.
