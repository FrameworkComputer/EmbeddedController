    help
      Enable this for a device which can be a tablet as well as a clamshell.
      Tablet mode detection is done either by using the lid angle
      measurement, or by the dedicated GMR sensor; or from external sensor hub
      via GPIO, or I2C. One example of the external sensor hub is ISH.

    bool "Tablet Mode Switch"
    depends on PLATFORM_EC_MKBP_INPUT_DEVICES
    help
      Enable a virtual switch to indicate when we are in tablet mode. The tablet
      mode state is sent to AP via MKBP protocol(switch event).

config PLATFORM_EC_GMR_TABLET_MODE
    bool "Giant Magnetoresistance(GMR) Tablet Mode"
    help
      Enable this to use GMR sensor to detect tablet mode.
      It requires to set GPIO_TABLET_MODE_L to map the interrupt from
      the sensor and direct its mapping to gmr_tablet_switch_isr
      in common/tablet_mode.c.
