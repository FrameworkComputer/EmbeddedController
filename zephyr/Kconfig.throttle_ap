if PLATFORM_EC_THROTTLE_AP

config PLATFORM_EC_CHIPSET_CAN_THROTTLE
	bool "CPU can support throttling"
	default y
	help
	  Indicates that the SoC supports throttling. This means that a
	  chipset_throttle_cpu() function is provided by the chipset, to be
	  called to set the throttle state. The typical implementation asserts
	  GPIO_CPU_PROCHOT, to make the CPU slow down.

config PLATFORM_EC_CONSOLE_CMD_APTHROTTLE
	bool "Console command: apthrottle"
	default y
	help
	  This command shows the current status of AP throttling. Both soft
	  (type 0) and hard (type 1) throttling are supported. Soft throttling
	  is typically controlled by the AP via a host event. Hard throttling
	  typically uses the PROCHOT (Processor Hot) signal on x86 CPUs.

	  Example output:

	     AP throttling type 0 is off (0x00000000)
	     AP throttling type 1 is off (0x00000000)

config PLATFORM_EC_THROTTLE_AP_ON_BAT_DISCHG_CURRENT
	bool "Throttle AP based on battery discharge current"
	default n
	help
	  Throttle the CPU when battery discharge current is too high. When
	  this feature is enabled, the threshold value must be set in
	  PLATFORM_EC_THROTTLE_AP_ON_BAT_DISCHG_CURRENT_LIMIT.

	default 0
endif

config PLATFORM_EC_THROTTLE_AP_ON_BAT_LOW_VOLTAGE
	bool "Throttle AP based on battery voltage"
	default n
	help
	  Throttle the CPU when battery voltage drops below a defined threshold
	  where the board still boots but some components don't function
	  perfectly. When this feature is enabled, the threshold value must be
	  set in PLATFORM_EC_THROTTLE_AP_ON_BAT_LOW_VOLTAGE_THRESH.

if PLATFORM_EC_THROTTLE_AP_ON_BAT_LOW_VOLTAGE

config PLATFORM_EC_THROTTLE_AP_ON_BAT_LOW_VOLTAGE_THRESH
	int "Low voltage threshold in millivolts"
	default 0
endif

config PLATFORM_EC_GPU_NVIDIA
	bool "Nvidia GPU supports throttling"
	default n
	help
	  Enable GPU throttling. When the GPU is throttled, a software (D-Notify)
	  and a hardware throttle (GPIO_NVIDIA_GPU_ACOFF_ODL) are enabled. A
	  hardware throttle will be automatically disabled after a fixed period
	  of time but a software throttle may remain and keep changing as the
	  situation changes.
