config PLATFORM_EC_CONSOLE_CMD_GETTIME
	bool "Console command: gettime"
	default y
	help
	  Enable the "gettime" command. This shows the current time (in
	  microseconds since boot) in both hex and in decimal converted to
	  seconds. For example:

	     Time: 0x0000000002706a62 = 40.921698 s


config PLATFORM_EC_CONSOLE_CMD_TIMERINFO
	bool "Console command: timerinfo"
	default y
	help
	  Enable the "timerinfo" command which shows the current time (in
	  microseconds and seconds since boot), the deadline (next time the EC
	  needs to wake up) and a list of active timers along with when they
	  will next fire.

	  Example:

	    Time:     0x0000000002706a62 us,   40.921698 s
	    Deadline: 0x000000000270774d ->    0.003307 s from now
	    Active timers:
	      Tsk  1  0x000000000271db8f ->    0.094509
	      Tsk  4  0x00000000027396b3 ->    0.207953
	      Tsk 13  0x00000000027133a1 ->    0.051519


config PLATFORM_EC_CONSOLE_CMD_WAITMS
	bool "Console command: waitms"
	default y
	help
	  Enable the "waitms" command. This waits for a given number of
	  milliseconds. For example:

	    waitms 100

	  waits for 100ms. Note that long waits can introduce problems since
	  it stops the EC from executing its normal tasks. For example, a
	  two-second wait can cause the EC to reset.
