	help
	  This enables common BC1.2 (Battery-Charging Specification Rev1.2)
	  charger-detection routines. With this is possible to negotiate a
	  power contract with an attached battery charger and use this to
	  charge the device's battery.

	  Helper symbol use in the common EC code for Zephyr specific charger
	  changes.

	bool
	help
	  This is a helper symbol that indicates the BC1.2 chip needs to be
	  triggered on data role swaps in addition to VBUS changes.

	  This is a Dual-Role USB Charging-Type Detector. It can operate in
	  host or client mode. It supports Battery Charging Specification, rev
	  1.2 (BC1.2) with Standard/Charging/Dedicated downstream port
	  (SDP/CDP/DCP) advertisement when in host mode. In client mode it
	  starts BC1.2 detection to detect the attached host type. It provides
	  an I2C interface to report detection results.

config PLATFORM_EC_BC12_DETECT_MT6360
	bool "MediaTek MT6360P PMIC"
	help
	  This PMIC includes a battery charger with an On-The-Go (OTG) output
	  range of 4.85 to 5.825V. It provides integrated ADCs for system
	  monitoring. The MT6360 also supports USB Power Delivery 3.0 with
	  Dual-Role, with host or client mode. It supports alternate mode as
	  well as VCONN with programmable over-current protection (OCP).

	depends on PLATFORM_EC_BC12_DETECT_MT6360
	help
	  If enabled, the MT6360 USB-PHY connection is controlled by
	  a GPIO: GPIO_BC12_DET_EN. Assert GPIO_BC12_DET_EN to detect a BC1.2
	  device, and deassert GPIO_BC12_DET_EN to mux the USB-PHY back.

config PLATFORM_EC_BC12_SINGLE_DRIVER
	bool "Only support a single BC12 driver"
	default y
	help
	  Enable this if the board only needs one BC12 driver. This includes
	  the case that has multiple chips that use the same driver.

	  If undefined, the board should define a bc12_ports[] array which
	  associates each port to its bc12 driver:

	     struct bc12_config bc12_ports[CONFIG_USB_PD_PORT_MAX_COUNT] = {
	        { .drv = &xxx_drv },
	        { .drv = &yyy_drv },
	     };
