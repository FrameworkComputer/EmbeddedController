	depends on !PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_VDM_AP_CONTROL
	default y

	  This enables support for entering DisplayPort alternate mode as a
	  DFP from the Embedded Controller directly.  This flag gates all the

	default y
	help

	  Fast Role Swap, advertising the available power across all ports of a
	  multi-port charger, and USB4. If disabled, only USB Power Delivery
	  Rev2.0 functionality is supported.

	  This defaults to y because PD Rev3.0 is required for USB4
	  functionality.

	bool "Thunderbolt-compatible mode support"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_REV30
	default n

	bool "USB4 support"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_USB_PD_REV30
	default n
	help
	  This enables support for entering into USB4 mode between two port
	  partners. The provides new features such as higher speeds and more
	  flexible multiplexing of data on the cable for different purposes,
	  e.g. attaching multiple displays and storage devices on the same bus.
