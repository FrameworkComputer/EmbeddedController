	  Enable the common Chromium OS EC application. This prints a message,
	  starts the EC tasks and sets up any drivers that are needed.

	  This depends on PLATFORM_EC at present, since without the shimmed
	  tasks, almost nothing can operate.

	  Enable the Link Time Optimization (LTO) feature for the toolchain.
	  LTO expands the scope of optimizations to encompass the whole program,
	  reducing the image size.

	  At this time, LTO is only enabled for Chromium OS source files and
	  is not enabled for the Zephyr kernel or drivers due.
