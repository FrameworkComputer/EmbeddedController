# The armv7m-cros-eabi compiler-rt was compiled with assumption that it will
# run on Cortex-M4 MCU with enabled FPU. It means that even with '-mfpu=none'
# option the floating point instructions will be used (because they are used in
# compiler-rt). Let's enable FPU always when compiling for ARMv7-M with FPU.

# LLVM toolchains for ARM use newlib as libc, indicate that it's supported.
# Original config (definied in 'lib/libc/Kconfig') depends on
# TOOLCHAIN_HAS_NEWLIB == y, which means that TOOLCHAIN_HAS_NEWLIB must be set
# before Kconfig files are processed. The only place that satisfies this
# requirement is ${ZEPHYR_BASE}/cmake/toolchain/llvm/generic.cmake, but due to
# HWMv2 we don't know the architecture at that point. The architecture is
# determined while processing Kconfig files, so let's indicate that Newlib is
# supported here.
