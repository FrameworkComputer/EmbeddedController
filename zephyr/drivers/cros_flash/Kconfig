	  This option enables a flash unit interface (FIU) driver for the NPCX
	  chip. This is used instead of the flash memory interface so we can
	  continue to use most of the existing flash memory processing code in
	  ECOS.

	  This sets the priority of the NPCX flash driver for zephyr shim.
	  This driver depends on the NPCX QSPI bus controller and NPCX NOR flash

	  This option enables the cros-flash driver used by EC code.
	  This driver actually acts as a translation layer between Zephyr flash
	  driver and EC flash protection flags (ro_now, ro_at_boot, etc.). The
	  driver uses a backend to perform flash specific operations, e.g.
	  change protection settings.

	  flash protection changes or basic flash operations.

	  Backend performs these operations using extended operations exposed by
