	bool "Nuvoton NPCX flash driver for the Zephyr shim"
	depends on SOC_FAMILY_NPCX

	select PLATFORM_EC_FLASH_CROS
	help
	  This option enables a flash unit interface (FIU) driver for the NPCX
	  chip. This is used instead of the flash memory interface so we can
	  continue to use most of the existing flash memory processing code in
	  ECOS.

	help
	  This sets the priority of the NPCX flash driver for zephyr shim.
	  This driver depends on the SPI controller and SPI NOR flash drivers.
	  Its priority must be lower than CONFIG_SPI_INIT_PRIORITY and
	  CONFIG_SPI_NOR_INIT_PRIORITY.

	  This option enables the flash driver for the it8xxx2 chip. We can
	  access the flash by read, write and erase. The it8xxx2 flash size

	  This option enables the flash driver for the MEC172x chips. Flash
	  access is via the QSPI driver to one of three ports: internal 512KB
	  SPI flash in the MEC1727 or external shared or private ports on
	  MEC1723, etc.
