	  This option enables a driver for providing raw access to the
	  keyboard-scan peripheral in the chip. This is used instead of the
	  kscan interface so we can continue to use most of the existing

	  This option enables quasi-bidirectional buffers for KSO pins. The
	  low-impedance high drive is active when ec changes the output data
	  buffers from 0 to 1, thereby reducing the low-to-high transition time.
