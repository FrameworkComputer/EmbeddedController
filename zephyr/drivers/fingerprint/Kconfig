	  Driver for FPC1025 fingerprint sensor. It requires FPC private library
	  to implement cros_fingerprint API. If the library is not available it
	  only supports checking sensor hardware ID and entering low power mode.

	  Size of heap to be used by FPC private library. The heap must have
	  enough size to keep finger templates during matching.
	  64KB is enough to match 5 templates at once.

	  This is a size of fingerprint image with an additional metadata.
	  This size must be at least a size of raw image. For FPC1025,
	  the size of a raw image is 25600 and the size of metadata is 660, so
	  the total data is 26260 bytes.

	  If provided, the value will be used as a size of image buffer.
	  Otherwise it will be obtained from width, height and bits per pixel
	  properties.

	  This is an offset of the raw fingerprint image in the image data
	  buffer.

	  This option overrides the default offset (0).
