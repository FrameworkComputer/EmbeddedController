	int "PDC message tracing FIFO size"
	range 128 65536
	default 1024
	help
	  This is the byte size of the PDC message tracing FIFO. When
	  tracing is active, the FIFO needs to be deep enough to absorb
	  delays on the AP side when retrieving messages. When the FIFO
	  is full, messages are tail-dropped which effectively disables
	  tracing until the FIFO drains. The FIFO is allocated in EC
	  RAM, so some sizing judgment may be necessary on ECs with
	  limited RAM.

	  messages.

config USBC_PDC_TRACE_MSG_HOST_CMD

	help
	  Enable host command for collecting PDC communication trace
	  messages.
