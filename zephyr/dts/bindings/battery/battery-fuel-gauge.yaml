   Battery fuel gauge parameters

compatible: "battery-fuel-gauge"

properties:
   manuf_name:
      description: Manufacturer name
      type: string
   device_name:
      description: Model/Device name
      type: string
   ship_mode_wb_support:
      description: |
         Write Block support. If this is true, then i2c write block command
         will be used instead of a 16-bit write
         Value must be either 0 or 1.
      type: int
   ship_mode_reg_addr:
      description: |
         Address of register responsible for enabling ship mode.
      type: int
   ship_mode_reg_data:
      description: |
         Values written to register to enable ship mode.
      type: array
   sleep_mode_support:
      description: |
         Defines if battery support fuel gauge sleep command.
         Value must be either 0 or 1.
      type: int
   sleep_mode_reg_addr:
      description: |
         Defines address where command will be sent to go into sleep mode.
      type: int
   sleep_mode_reg_data:
      description: |
         Defines value which will be sent to register to go into sleep mode.
      type: int
   fet_mfgacc_support:
      description: |
         Defines if battery supports manufacturer access command.
         If enabled, FET status is read using the ManufacturerBlockAccess (0x44)
         to read the OperationStatus (0x54) register.
         The fet_reg_mask and fet_disconnect_val properties must still be
         defined.
         Value must be either 0 or 1.
      type: int
   fet_reg_addr:
      description: |
         Address of register which reports charging and discharging FETs status.
         This property is ignored if fet_mfgacc_support is true.
      type: int
   fet_reg_mask:
      description: |
         Mask which determines which bit in status value contains the
         discharge FET status.
      type: int
   fet_disconnect_val:
      description: |
         Value that describes which bits must be set to determine that
         discharge FET has disconnected the battery.
      type: int
   fet_cfet_mask:
      description: |
         Mask which determines which bit in status value contains the
         charge FET status. If this value is 0, this means there's
         no charge FET.
      type: int
   fet_cfet_off_val:
      description: |
         Value that describes which bits must be set to determine that
         charge FET has disconnected the battery.
      type: int
   imbalance_mv:
      description: |
         This property is used only if
         CONFIG_PLATFORM_EC_BATTERY_MEASURE_IMBALANCE is enabled.
         It should be an enum and its value should be a name of function
         which will be assigned to imbalance_mv pointer.
      type: string
