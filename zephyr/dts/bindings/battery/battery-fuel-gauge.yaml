   Battery fuel gauge parameters

properties:
  manuf_name:
    description: |
      String returned by the smart battery attribute
      ManufacturerName (0x20), which is used to help
      uniquely identify the type of battery.
    type: string
  device_name:
    description: |
      String returned by the smart battery attribute
      DeviceName (0x21), which is used to help
      uniquely identify the type of battery.
    type: string
  flags:
    description: |
      Fuel gauge flags. e.g FG_FLAG_SLEEP_MODE
    type: int
  ship_mode_reg_addr:
    description: |
       Address of register responsible for enabling ship mode.
    type: int
  ship_mode_reg_data:
    description: |
       Values written to register to enable ship mode.
    type: array
  sleep_mode_reg_addr:
    description: |
       Defines address where command will be sent to go into sleep mode.
    type: int
  sleep_mode_reg_data:
    description: |
       Defines value which will be sent to register to go into sleep mode.
    type: int
  fet_reg_addr:
    description: |
       Address of register which reports charging and discharging FETs status.
       This property is ignored if fet_mfgacc_support is true.
    type: int
  fet_reg_mask:
    description: |
       Mask which determines which bit in status value contains the
       discharge FET status.
    type: int
  fet_disconnect_val:
    description: |
       Value that describes which bits must be set to determine that
       discharge FET has disconnected the battery.
    type: int
  fet_cfet_mask:
    description: |
       Mask which determines which bit in status value contains the
       charge FET status. If this value is 0, this means there's
       no charge FET.
    type: int
  fet_cfet_off_val:
    description: |
       Value that describes which bits must be set to determine that
       charge FET has disconnected the battery.
    type: int
  imbalance_mv:
    description: |
       This property is used only if
       CONFIG_PLATFORM_EC_BATTERY_MEASURE_IMBALANCE is enabled.
       It should be an enum and its value should be a name of function
       which will be assigned to imbalance_mv pointer.
    type: string
