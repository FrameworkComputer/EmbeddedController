   Voltage is in millivolts
   Current is in milliamperes
   Temperature is in Celsius degrees

compatible: "battery-info"

properties:
   voltage_max:
      description: |
         Maximum voltage that can be applied to the battery.
      type: int
   voltage_normal:
      description: |
         Nominal voltage of the battery.
      type: int
   voltage_min:
      description: |
         Minimum voltage of the battery.
         If current voltage is below this value, system will shutdown.
      type: int
   precharge_voltage:
      description: |
         Voltage used during the precharge phase. Not all chargers
         may take these into account.
      type: int
   precharge_current:
      description: |
         Maximum current used during the precharge phase.
      type: int
   start_charging_min_c:
      description: |
         Minimum temperature of battery to start charging it.
         This value is used only if
         CONFIG_PLATFORM_EC_BATTERY_CHECK_CHARGE_TEMP_LIMITS is enabled.
      type: int
   start_charging_max_c:
      description: |
         Maximum temperature of battery to start charging it.
         This value is used only if
         CONFIG_PLATFORM_EC_BATTERY_CHECK_CHARGE_TEMP_LIMITS is enabled.
      type: int
   charging_min_c:
      description: |
         Minimum temperature of battery during charging it. If the battery
         temperature falls below this value, charging will be stopped.
         This value is used only if
         CONFIG_PLATFORM_EC_BATTERY_CHECK_CHARGE_TEMP_LIMITS is enabled.
      type: int
   charging_max_c:
      description: |
         Maximum temperature of battery during charging it. If the battery
         temperature raises above this value, charging will be stopped.
         This value is used only if
         CONFIG_PLATFORM_EC_BATTERY_CHECK_CHARGE_TEMP_LIMITS is enabled.
      type: int
   discharging_min_c:
      description: |
         Minimum working temperature of battery.
         If temperature is below this value, the system will shutdown.
      type: int
   discharging_max_c:
      description: |
         Maximum working temperature of battery.
         If temperature is above this value, the system will shutdown.
      type: int
