description: Describes the size and offset of the RO and RW regions

compatible: "cros-ec,flash-layout"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  type:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: >-
      A property required by the binman utility, defined here only to
      prevent Zephyr's binding generator from erroring about
      additional properties.

      The property should be set to the value "section" (done by
      binman.dtsi) and should not be used anywhere in C code.

      See README.entries in binman for a description of what binman
      uses this for.
  offset:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: >-
      The offset of the flash region from the base of the flash.
  size:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: >-
      The size of the flash region, in bytes.
  read-only:
    type: boolean
    description: >-
      Set if the section should be read-only.
  preserve:
    type: boolean
    description: >-
      Set if the section should be preserved when updating firmware. This is
      just a signal. Enforcement of this is upto the updater.
  fill-byte:
    type: uint8-array
    description: >-
      Set if the section bytes should be filled with configured byte value.
  pad-byte:
    type: int
    description: >-
      Set the pad byte to use when padding in the region. It
      defaults to 0. To use 0xff, you would add 'pad-byte = <0xff>'.
  image-size:
    type: int
    description: >-
      Set the image size to use when preforming read and write to the region
      through drivers, in bytes.
