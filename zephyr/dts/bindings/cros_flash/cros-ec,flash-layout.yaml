description: Describes the size and offset of the RO and RW regions

compatible: "cros-ec,flash-layout"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  type:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: >-
      A property required by the binman utility, defined here only to
      prevent Zephyr's binding generator from erroring about
      additional properties.

      The property should be set to the value "section" (done by
      binman.dtsi) and should not be used anywhere in C code.

      See README.entries in binman for a description of what binman
      uses this for.
  offset:
    type: int
    description: >-
      The offset of the flash region from the base of the flash.
  offset-from-elf:
    type: compound
    description: >-
      The offset of an entry based on a symbol value in an another entry.
      The format is <&phandle>, "sym_name", <offset> where phandle is the entry
      containing the blob (with associated ELF file providing symbols), <sym_name>
      is the symbol to lookup (relative to elf-base-sym) and <offset> is an offset
      to add to that value.

      Note that this format is not a supported pattern in Zephyr. Use the type
      "compound" which a dummy type for properties that don't fit any of the
      supported patterns.
  size:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: >-
      The size of the flash region, in bytes.
  read-only:
    type: boolean
    description: >-
      Set if the section should be read-only.
  preserve:
    type: boolean
    description: >-
      Set if the section should be preserved when updating firmware. This is
      just a signal. Enforcement of this is upto the updater.
  overlap:
    type: boolean
    description: >-
      Indicates that this entry overlaps with others in the same section. These
      entries should appear at the end of the section. Overlapping entries are not
      packed with other entries, but their contents are written over other entries
      in the section. Overlapping entries must have an explicit offset and size.
  fill-byte:
    type: uint8-array
    description: >-
      Set if the section bytes should be filled with configured byte value.
  pad-byte:
    type: int
    description: >-
      Set the pad byte to use when padding in the region. It
      defaults to 0. To use 0xff, you would add 'pad-byte = <0xff>'.
  filename:
    type: string
    description: >-
      This allows the contents of the section to be written to a file in the
      output directory. This can sometimes be useful to use the data in one
      section in different image, since there is currently no way to share data
      beteen images other than through files.
  image-size:
    type: int
    description: >-
      Set the image size to use when preforming read and write to the region
      through drivers, in bytes.
