      Numeral system used to decode values
      - binary - expects array with values of 0 and 1.
      - binary_first_base3 - non-standard ternary number system
          where the first 2^n natural numbers are represented as
          they would be in a binary system (without any Z digits)
          and the following 3^n-2^n numbers use the remaining
          ternary representations in the normal ternary system order
      - ternary - expects array with values of 0, 1 and 2.
          It treats 'Z' state as digit '2'.
    enum:
      - binary
      - binary_first_base3
      - ternary
