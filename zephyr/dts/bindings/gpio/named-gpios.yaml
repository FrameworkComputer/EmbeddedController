    #
    # Must name this property [..-]gpios which
    # is treated specially (looks for #gpio-cells
    # in referenced node so that cell properties can
    # be specified). If this property does not exist, treat
    # this GPIO as unimplemented.

    no-auto-init:
      description:
        When set, the GPIO is not initialised, and can be
        initialised separately in code, but is still saved so that
        it appears in the list of GPIOs.

        When not set, the GPIO h/w is configured and initialised at startup
        according to the flags in the gpios node.
      type: boolean
    alias:
      description:
        When set, defines an alias for this GPIO's enum-name.

        This is to allow common or generic names in legacy code to map
        to the particular board's GPIO name.
