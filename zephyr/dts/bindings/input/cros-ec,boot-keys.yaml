  Boot keys definition.

  This can be used to define the key combinations that trigger boot key events:
  recovery mode, force memory retraining and boot without starting the AP.

  Example configuration:

  kbd {
      boot-keys {
          compatible = "cros-ec,boot-keys";
          down-arrow-rc = <KBD_RC(6, 11)>;
          esc-rc = <KBD_RC(1, 1)>;
          left-shift-rc = <KBD_RC(5, 7)>;
          refresh-rc = <KBD_RC(3, 2)>;
      };
  };

compatible: "cros-ec,boot-keys"
