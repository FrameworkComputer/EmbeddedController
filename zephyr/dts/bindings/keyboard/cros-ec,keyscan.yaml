description: Keyboard scanning properties

compatible: "cros-ec,keyscan"

properties:
  output-settle:
    type: int
    default: 80
    description: |
        Delay time, in microseconds, between setting up output and waiting for
        it to settle. 80 microseconds is the recommended value when column 2
        of the keyboard passes through the Google Security Chip. Otherwise 50
        microseconds is the recommended value.

  debounce-down:
    type: int
    default: 9000
    description: |
        Time, in microseconds, to debounce key-down.

  debounce-up:
    type: int
    default: 30000
    description: |
        Time, in microseconds, to debounce key-up.

  scan-period:
    type: int
    default: 3000
    description: |
        Time between scans when keyboard scan task runs in polling mode.

  min-post-scan-delay:
    type: int
    default: 1000
    description: |
        Minimum time between end of one scan and start of the next one.
        This ensures keyboard scanning doesn't starve the rest of the system
        if the scan period is set too short, or if other higher-priority
        system activity is starving the keyboard scan task too.

  poll-timeout:
    type: int
    default: 100000
    description: |
        Revert to interrupt mode after no keyboard activity for this period.
        Specified in microseconds.

  actual-key-mask:
    type: array
    default: [
      0x1c, # C0
      0xff, # C1
      0xff, # C2
      0xff, # C3
      0xff, # C4
      0xf5, # C5
      0xff, # C6
      0xa4, # C7
      0xfe, # C8
      0x55, # C9
      0xfa, # C10
      0xff, # C11
      0xca, # C12
      0x00, # C13 for keypad
      0x00, # C14 for keypad
    ]
    description: |
        Keyboard scanning mask. For each keyboard column, specify which
        keyboard rows actually exist. Default key mask includes scanning for
        full Chromebook keyboard, excluding the keypad.
