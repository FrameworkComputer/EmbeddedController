description: GPIO LED pins parent node

compatible: "cros-ec,gpio-led-pins"

child-binding:
  description: |
    Each child node describes all the GPIO pins that need to be altered to set
    the color of a specific LED.
    e.g. For a board with 2 GPIO pins that make up a battery LED, the node looks
    like:
    battery_led: battery-led {
                   led-id = "EC_LED_ID_BATTERY_LED";
                   led-pins = <&gpio_ec_chg_led_y_c1
                               &gpio_ec_chg_led_w_c1>;
                };
  properties:
    led-id:
      type: string
      required: true
      description: |
        This property is required by the EC_CMD_LED_CONTROL host command.
        It must match the enum names defined in ec_commands.h.
      enum:
        - EC_LED_ID_BATTERY_LED
        - EC_LED_ID_POWER_LED
        - EC_LED_ID_ADAPTER_LED
        - EC_LED_ID_LEFT_LED
        - EC_LED_ID_RIGHT_LED
        - EC_LED_ID_RECOVERY_HW_REINIT_LED
        - EC_LED_ID_SYSRQ_DEBUG_LED
    led-pins:
      type: phandles
      required: true
      description: |
        This property is used to specify an array of gpio pins to set a
        particular color.

      Each grandchild node describes all the colors supported by the child LED.
      e.g. For a board supporting Blue and Amber LEDs - to set LED_AMBER color,
      amber LED will need to be set to 1 and blue LED to 0. 1 always turns on
      the LED and 0 always turns off the LED. So a node looks like
      color-amber {
                   led-color = "LED_AMBER";
                   led-values = <1 0>;
                  };
    properties:
      led-color:
        type: string
        required: true
        description: |
          This property is used to identify pin nodes based on color enum.
          It is required by the EC_CMD_LED_CONTROL host command.
        enum:
          - LED_OFF
          - LED_RED
          - LED_GREEN
          - LED_BLUE
          - LED_YELLOW
          - LED_WHITE
          - LED_AMBER
      led-values:
        type: array
        required: true
        description: |
          This property is used to specify an array of values to set on the
          corresponding led-pins to set a particular color.
