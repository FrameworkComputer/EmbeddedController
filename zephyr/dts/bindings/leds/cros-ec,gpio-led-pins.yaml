description: GPIO LED pins parent node

compatible: "cros-ec,gpio-led-pins"

child-binding:
    description: Each child node describes all the GPIO pins that need to be
                 altered to set a specific color. Eg. for a board supporting
                 Blue and Amber LEDs - to set LED_AMBER color, amber LED will
                 need to be set to 1 and blue LED to 0. So a node looks like
                 color-amber {
                              led-color = "LED_AMBER";
                              led-pins = <&gpio_ec_chg_led_y_c1 1>,
                                         <&gpio_ec_chg_led_b_c1 0>;
                             };
