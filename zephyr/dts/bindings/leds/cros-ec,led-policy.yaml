description: LED policy parent node

    description: |
      LED policy nodes to describe the policy combination a node depends on, and
      the color to set to for that combination.
      e.g. If Blue color needs to be set for charge state discharge in S0, a
      node looks like
      power-state-discharge-s0 {
         charge-state = "PWR_STATE_DISCHARGE";
         chipset-state = "POWER_S0";
         charge-port = <0>;
         color-0 {
           led-color = <&color_blue>;
         };
      };

    properties:
        charge-state:
            description: |
              If the LED color depends on charge state, this property is used
              to describe it.
              PWR_STATE_CHARGE - AC is connected, battery is charging.
              PWR_STATE_DISCHARGE - AC is not connected, battery is discharging.
              PWR_STATE_ERROR - Battery is in error state.
              PWR_STATE_IDLE - AC is connected, battery is not charging.
              PWR_STATE_FORCED_IDLE - AC is connected, battery is not charging.
                                      Used during factory testing.
              PWR_STATE_CHARGE_NEAR_FULL - AC is connected, battery is charging
                                           and close to fully charged.
            type: string

        charge-port:
            description: |
              If the LED color depends on the charging port (left or right).

        chipset-state:
            description: |
              If the LED color depends on chipset state, this property is used
              to describe it.

            enum:

        batt-lvl:
            description: |
              If the LED color depends on current battery level, this property
              is used to describe batt_lvl range using closed interval [x,y].
              Use the macros defined in dt-bindings/battery.h.
              e.g. <BATTERY_LEVEL_EMPTY BATTERY_LEVEL_LOW> describes battery level
                   range of BATTERY_LEVEL_EMPTY to BATTERY_LEVEL_LOW inclusive.
