  description: |
    LED policy nodes to describe the policy combination a node depends on, and
    the color to set to for that combination.
    e.g. If Blue color needs to be set for charge state discharge in S0, a
    node looks like
    power-state-discharge-s0 {
       charge-state = "LED_PWRS_DISCHARGE";
       chipset-state = "POWER_S0";
       charge-port = <0>;
       led-0 {
         led-id = "EC_LED_ID_BATTERY_LED";
         color-0 {
           led-color = "LED_BLUE";
         };
       };
    };

  properties:
    charge-state:
      description: |
        If the LED color depends on charge state, this property is used
        to describe it.
        LED_PWRS_CHARGE - AC is connected, battery is charging.
        LED_PWRS_DISCHARGE - AC is not connected, battery is discharging.
        LED_PWRS_ERROR - Battery is in error state.
        LED_PWRS_IDLE - AC is connected, battery is not charging.
        LED_PWRS_FORCED_IDLE - AC is connected, battery is not charging.
                                Used during factory testing.
        LED_PWRS_CHARGE_NEAR_FULL - AC is connected, battery is charging
                                     and close to fully charged.
      type: string
      enum:
        - LED_PWRS_CHARGE
        - LED_PWRS_DISCHARGE
        - LED_PWRS_ERROR
        - LED_PWRS_IDLE
        - LED_PWRS_FORCED_IDLE
        - LED_PWRS_CHARGE_NEAR_FULL

    charge-port:
      description: |
        If the LED color depends on the charging port (left or right).
      type: int

    chipset-state:
      description: |
        If the LED color depends on chipset state, this property is used
        to describe it.
      type: string
      enum:
        - POWER_S0
        - POWER_S3
        - POWER_S5

    batt-state-mask:
      description: |
        If the LED color depends on battery state, this property is used
        to describe the kind of battery state.
        Use the macros defined in dt-bindings/battery.h.
        e.g. SB_STATUS_DISCHARGING - Battery is discharging.
      type: int

    batt-state:
      description: |
        If the LED color depends on battery state, this property is used
        to select the battery state value base on batt-state-mask.
      type: int

    batt-lvl:
      description: |
        If the LED color depends on current battery level, this property
        is used to describe batt_lvl range using closed interval [x,y].
        Use the macros defined in dt-bindings/battery.h.
        e.g. <BATTERY_LEVEL_EMPTY BATTERY_LEVEL_LOW> describes battery level
             range of BATTERY_LEVEL_EMPTY to BATTERY_LEVEL_LOW inclusive.

      transition:
        description: |
