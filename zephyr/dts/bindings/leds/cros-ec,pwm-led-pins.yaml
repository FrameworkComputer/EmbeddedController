description: PWM LED pins parent node

compatible: "cros-ec,pwm-led-pins"

child-binding:
    description: |
      Each child node describes all the PWM pins that need to be altered to set
      a specific color.
      e.g. For blue and amber PWM channels, in order to set color amber, a node
      looks like this where 100 is PWM duty cycle in percentage.
      color-amber {
                   led-color = "LED_AMBER";
                   led-pins = <&pwm_led_y 100>,
                              <&pwm_led_b 0>;
                  };

              This property is used to identify pin nodes based on color enum.
              It is required by the EC_CMD_LED_CONTROL host command.

              This property is required by the EC_CMD_LED_CONTROL host command.
              It must match the enum names defined in ec_commands.h.

              This is used in the ectool brightness range APIs. It must match

            description: |
              This property is used to specify an array of PWM pins and
              corresponding values to enable a particular color.
              e.g. Amber color - led-pins = <&pwm_led_y 100>,
                                            <&pwm_led_b 0>;
