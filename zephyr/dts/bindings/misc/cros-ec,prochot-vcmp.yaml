  PROCHOT signal detection, uses a voltage comparator device to detect
  transitions of the PROCHOT signal and log it on the console if the AP is
  active.

  Example configuration:

  prochot-vcmp {
      compatible = "cros-ec,prochot-vcmp";
      vcmp = <&vcmp0>;
      high-level-mv = <1050>;
  };

  &vcmp0 {
      status = "okay";
      scan-period = <IT8XXX2_VCMP_SCAN_PERIOD_5MS>;
      comparison = <IT8XXX2_VCMP_GREATER>;
      threshold-mv = <0>;
      io-channels = <&adc0 0>;
  };

  &adc0 {
      pinctrl-0 = <&adc0_ch0_gpi0_default>; /* ...and other ADC signals */
      pinctrl-names = "default";
  };

  Note: the voltage comparator initial configuration is irrelevant, the device
  is reconfigured automatically in runtime.
