description: Body detection configuration parameters
properties:
  var_noise_factor:
    type: int
    description: |
      The unit is percentage
      This is used for mitigate the effect of the noise from sensor.
      If set to 100%, the average noise is canceled out.
  var_threshold:
    type: int
    description: |
      The unit is (mm/s^2)^2
      The motion confidence is calculated if the variance is within
      variance_threshold +/- confidence_delta. Otherwise, if variance
      is too high/low, confidence will be 100%/0%
  confidence_delta:
    type: int
    description: |
      The unit is (mm/s^2)^2
      The motion confidence is calculated if the variance is within
      variance_threshold +/- confidence_delta. Otherwise, if variance
      is too high/low, confidence will be 100%/0%
