    A rotation matrix node is used to create
    an instance of mat33_fp_t which is used by
    sensor drivers.

        3x3 matrix to rotate x, y, and z axes.
        Applications with the sensor API expects sansor data
        based on the same defined coordinate system.
        * X-axis is horizontal and positive toward the right
        * Y-axis is vertical and positive toward the top
        * Z-axis points toward the user

        Depending on how the sensor is mounted on board(PCB), we
        may need to change the direction of a axis and swap X and
        Y-axis. Using the 3x3 matrix, it generates the correct
        X,Y, and Z on the defined coordinate system.
