    A config node is used to create a motion_data_t instance.
    Node name can only be either ap, ec-s0, ec-s3, or ec-s5,
    and it is used to indicate one of the 4 configurations.
    For example, node name ec-s0 is for SENSOR_CONFIG_EC_S0.
    ec-s0 {
       odr = <1000>;
       ec_rate = <1000>;
    };
  properties:
    odr:
      type: int

        Sensor output data rate in mHz.
        MSB is used to know if we are rounding up.
    ec-rate:
      type: int
      default: 0
