description: The node has the information required by motion sense running

compatible: "cros-ec,motionsense-sensor-info"

properties:
  als-sensors:
    type: phandles
    description: |
        List of ALS sensors to create motion_als_sensors array.
        The ALS sensors listed in the motion_als_sensors array
        are managed by motion sense task. The task reads the sensor
        data from the sensors and put them into the designated part
        in the ec mmap. For example, als_clear and als_rgb are aliases
        of ALS sensor noded defined in motionsense-sensor node.
        als-sensors = <&als_clear, &als_rgb>;
        This will automatically generate motion_als_sensors array from it.
  sensor-irqs:
    type: phandles
    description: |
        List of interrupts from sensors GPIOS to be enabled.
        Interrupts specified here will be enabled before motion sense task starts.
        sensor-irqs = <&int_imu &int_als_rgb>;
  accel-force-mode-sensors:
    type: phandles
    description: |
        List of sensors should be handled in force mode. Sensors listed will be
        used to define CONFIG_ACCEL_FORCE_MODE_MASK so that motion sense task can
        manage them in force mode.
        accel-force-mode-sensors = <&lid_accel &als_clear>;
