  mutex:
    type: phandle

    description: phandle to driver data to be used for the motion sensor.
      Some drivers require this to be a global shared datas structure
      used by all instances of this device, others require separate
      data structures for each instance.

    type: phandle
    description: phandle to another sensor that can be swapped with this one
      at runtime.
  alternate-ssfc-indicator:
    type: phandle
    description: phandle to CBI SSFC value indicating that the sensor
      should be used
  int-signal:
    type: phandle
    description: pin which triggers interrupt for sensor
