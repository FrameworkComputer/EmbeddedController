      ID bit for loopback detection. The implementation uses this ID to detect
      if a packet is sent from remote or not. The two sides of one-wire uart
      application must set different ID.

      For CrOS detachable devices, ID can be auto-detected using the existence
      of CONFIG_PLATFORM_EC_DETACHABLE_BASE. No need to set manually.
