    description: |
      If set, do NOT consider this node to be an independent PD chip and
      instruct Depthcharge to NOT apply firmware updates to this device. For
      two-port PDC devices where each port has its own DT node, one of them
      should have this property set to avoid updating the same chip twice
      through each port.
