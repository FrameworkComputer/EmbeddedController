config EMUL_COMMON_I2C
	bool "Common handler for I2C emulator messages"
	help
	  Enable common code that is used by many emulators of devices on I2C
	  bus. It allows to share code for handling I2C messages, locking and
	  custom user handlers between these emulators.

config EMUL_SMART_BATTERY
	bool "Smart Battery emulator"
	select EMUL_COMMON_I2C
	help
	  Enable the Smart Battery emulator. This driver use emulated I2C bus.

config EMUL_BMA255
	bool "BMA255 emulator"
	select EMUL_COMMON_I2C
	help
	  Enable the BMA255 emulator. This driver use emulated I2C bus.
	  It is used to test bma2x2 driver. Emulators API is available in
	  zephyr/include/emul/emul_bma255.h

config EMUL_BC12_DETECT_PI3USB9201
	bool "PI3USB9201 emulator"
	help
	  Enable the PI3USB9201 emulator. PI3USB9201 is a BC1.2 charger
	  detector/advertiser. The emulator supports reading and writing the
	  4 I2C registers of the PI3USB9201 using the emulated I2C bus.

config EMUL_PPC_SYV682X
	bool "Silergy SYV682x PPC emulator"
	select PLATFORM_EC_USBC_PPC_SYV682X
	help
	  Enable the SYV682x emulator. SYV682 is a USB Type-C PPC. This driver
	  uses the emulated I2C bus.

config EMUL_BMI
	bool "BMI emulator"
	select EMUL_COMMON_I2C
	help
	  Enable the BMI emulator. This driver use emulated I2C bus.
	  It is used to test bmi 160 and 260 drivers. Emulators API is
	  available in zephyr/include/emul/emul_bmi.h

config EMUL_TCS3400
	bool "TCS3400 emulator"
	select EMUL_COMMON_I2C
	help
	  Enable the TCS3400 light sensor. This driver use emulated I2C bus.
	  It is used to test als_tcs3400 driver. It supports reading sensor
	  values which are correctly scaled using current gain and integration
	  time configuration, switching between IR and clear sensor and
	  clearing status register using clear interrupt registers. Other
	  TCS3400 registers support read and write with optional checking
	  of proper access to reserved bits. Emulators API is available in
	  zephyr/include/emul/emul_tcs3400.h

config EMUL_BB_RETIMER
	bool "BB retimer emulator"
	select EMUL_COMMON_I2C
	help
	  Enable the BB (Burnside Bridge) retimer emulator. This driver use
	  emulated I2C bus. It is used to test bb_retimer driver. It supports
	  reads and writes to all emulator registers. Emulators API is
	  available in zephyr/include/emul/emul_bb_retimer.h
