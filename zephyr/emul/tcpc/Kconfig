	  Enable the TCPCI emulator. This driver uses the emulated I2C bus.
	  It is used to test tcpci code. It supports reads and writes to all
	  emulator registers. Generic TCPCI emulator can be used as the base
	  for specific TCPC device emulator that follow TCPCI specification.
	  TCPCI emulator API is available in
	  zephyr/include/emul/tcpc/emul_tcpci.h
