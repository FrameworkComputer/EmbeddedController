/**
 * @file
 * @brief External API interface to AP power sequence subsystem.
 *
 * Defines the interface to the AP power sequence module,
 * which includes:
 *  - enums for the power state of the AP
 *  - enums for the power state mask of the AP
 *  - enums indicating the reason for shutdown
 *  - enums for providing control values
 *  - function declarations for getting the state of the AP
 *  - function declarations for requesting actions
 *
 * These definitions are roughly equivalent to the legacy
 * chipset API, but are separate to ensure there is no
 * reference to the legacy API. To reflect this,
 * equivalent functions are prepended with ap_power_ instead
 * of chipset_.
