/**
 * AP power sequence state machine API
 * -----------------------------------
 *
 * State machine is integrated into the AP power sequence driver by wrapping
 * Zephyr State Machine Framework (SMF), each SMF state is represented by three
 * functions or action handlers that define operations performed on state entry,
 * run and exit.
 *
 * ACPIâ€™s global state (G3) and its six sleep power states (S0, S1, S2, S3, S4,
 * S5) are present within this state machine domain. All these ACPI states are
 * are divided in three levels, each level is a SMF state with a hierarchical
 * relation with others action handlers of the same ACPI state, state handlers
 * at higher levels performes the most common task of corresponding ACPI power
 * states.
 *
 * Architecture is the highest level of the hierarchy, SMF states this level
 * must do operations that are specific to AP CPU architecture, example:
 * X86 (intel), ARM.
 *
 * Middle level is the chipset; these SMF action handlers carry out operations
 * to drive power of components that are required for the AP chip. Any bus
 * signal or internal power rail that is vital for chip execution is a good fit
 * to be handled in these action handlers. Examples of chipsets are: Tiger Lake
 * and Jasper Lake, these are Intel chipsets that use X86 architecture, and
 * MT8186 and MT8192 are Mediatek chipsets using ARM architecture.
 *
 * Application is the bottom level of the hierarchy and these SMF action
 * handlers are reserved to address board or application specific computations.
 *
 * Hierarchical SMF will coordinate execution of entry, run & exit functions
 * accordingly. Given that implementation is responsible for doing state
 * transitions, the following considerations should be taken when implementing
 * action state handlers:
 *
 * - Higher level `entry` actions are executed before the lower level `entry`
 * actions.
 * - Transitioning from one substate to another with a shared upper level state
 * does not re-execute the upper level `entry` action or execute the `exit`
 * action.
 * - Upper level `exit` actions are executed after the substate `exit` actions.
 * - Lower level `run` actions are executed before upper level.
 * - Upper level `run` actions only executes if no state transition has been
 * made from lower level `run` action.
 *
 * Please refer to Zephyr SMF documentation.
 *
 * This file exports macros that help to provide action handlers implementation
 * for all states, and any substate that is declared in devicetree. It also
 * declares functions to do power state transitions.
 *
 * Macros AP_POWER_ACRH_STATE_DEFINE, AP_POWER_CHIPSET_STATE_DEFINE and
 * AP_POWER_APP_STATE_DEFINE statically declare action handlers for each power
 * state.
 *
 * State Machine Workflow
 * ----------------------
 *
 * State machine execution is done within AP power sequence driver thread
 * context. Driver sets initial state upon initialization.
 *
 * On each driver thread loop ieration, current state `run` action handler is
 * called following hierarchical order as set in zephyr SMF.
 *
 * State machine implements Ultimate Hook pattern, this allows upper level
 * action handlers to finalize hierarchical execution flow by setting its
 * returning value to anything different than zero.
 *
 * `ap_pwrseq_sm_set_state` must be used to do state transition, this will
 * execute current state `exit` action handlers followed by next state `entry`
 * action handlers, completing state transtion on next thread loop iteration
 * when new state `run` action is called.
 *
 * State transitions are only permited to be done by implementation within
 * corresponding AP power sequence driver context, and only one state transition
 * is allowed per driver thread loop iteration.
 *
 * Example of wrong use of `ap_pwrseq_sm_set_state`:
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * int arch_s0_run(void *data)
 * {
 *     // Transition started `entry` and `exit` functions called
 *     ap_pwrseq_sm_set_state(data, AP_POWER_STATE_S5);
 *     ...
 *     // Nothing happens `ap_pwrseq_sm_set_state` returns -EINVAL.
 *     ap_pwrseq_sm_set_state(data, AP_POWER_STATE_G3);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Example of correct use of `ap_pwrseq_sm_set_state`:
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * int arch_s0_run(void *data)
 * {
 *     if (...) {
 *         return ap_pwrseq_sm_set_state(data, AP_POWER_STATE_S5);
 *     } else if (...) {
 *         return ap_pwrseq_sm_set_state(data, AP_POWER_STATE_G3);
 *     }
 *     return 0;
 * }
 * @endcod
 *
 * For this same reason, `ap_pwrseq_sm_set_state` should not be called within
 * `entry` or `exit` action handler.
