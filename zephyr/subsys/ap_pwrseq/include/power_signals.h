 * @file
 * @brief Definition of the power signals API.
 *
 * Defines the API for accessing the power signals.
 *
 * The AP power sequence code uses power signals to monitor and control
 * the startup and shutdown of the AP. These power signals may be
 * accessed from a variety of sources, such as GPIOs, eSPI virtual
 * wires, and board specific sources. Regardless of the source
 * of the signal or control, a single API is used to access these signals.
 * The configuration of the source of the signals is done via
 * devicetree, using a number of different compatibles each
 * representing a different source of the signals.
 *
 * The power sequence code identifies the signals via a common enum,
 * which is generated from a common set of enum names in devicetree.
 *
 * The API defined here also functions to deal with the signals
 * as a set i.e being able to watch for a certain set of signals
 * to become asserted.
 *
 * Intermediate layers provide a way of mapping these signals
 * to the underlying source; the intent is that these signals
 * provide a logical state for the signal, regardless of whatever
 * polarity the physical pin is defined as i.e an input signal may be
 * considered asserted if the voltage is low, but this is a platform
 * specific attribute, and should be configured at the h/w layer e.g
 * a GPIO that is asserted when low should be configured using the
 * GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW flag, so that the logical asserted signal is
 * read as '1', not '0'.
