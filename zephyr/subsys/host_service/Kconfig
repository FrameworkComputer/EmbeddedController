config HOST_SERVICE
	bool "HOST_SERVICE support"
	default n
	help
	  This option enables local-host communication support. If enabled,
	  local firmware can communicate with host SW. This function helps
	  managing the lower layer protocols and is transparent for
	  applications.

config HECI_CORE_ID
	int "heci core id for multiple cores system"
	default 0
	range 0 15
	help
	  HECI core id for multiple cores system.

config HOST_SERVICE_BOOT_DELAY
	int "Host Service Boot Delay"
	default 0
	help
	  Seconds to delay before starting Host Service. It is for boot
	  timeout issue of host drivers on platforms with slow booting,
	  liking FPGA.

config SYS_MNG
	bool "System Management Protocol support"
	select HECI
	default y
	help
	  Local-host system management commands handling, which includes
	  logic layer synchronization between local and host. This flag
	  should be set if there is no hal level synchronization.

config HECI
	bool "HECI Protocol support"
	default y
	help
	  Host HECI protocol. HECI (Host Embedded Controller Interface) is
	  used as a transport protocol for communication of main FW with the
	  host.
	  HECI provides a bi-directional fully asynchronous communications
	  interface between host software and firmware. HECI “Client” refers
	  to the software endpoints that send and receive messages via HECI.
	  The HECI Client Message Link refers to the connection between a host
	  client and a FW client. Clients can be drivers, services, or
	  applications depending upon the architecture of the software stack
	  interfacing with HECI.

config HECI_ROUTER
	bool "HECI ROUTER function support"
	default n
	help
	  heci router offers capability that fw can forward message between
	  host and another core fw, which can be used for cross core heci
	  functions

config RTD3
	bool "rtd3, run time d3 support"
	default n
	depends on PM
	help
	  Run time d3 offers capability that host drivers could enter d3 on run
	  time, to avoid device access during that time

config HOST_TIME_SYNC
	bool "sync host utc time"
	default y
	help
	  Sync host utc time. If enabled, HOST driver will send utc time to
	  sync with FW, which may be applied on sensor's timestamping.
