config PLATFORM_EC_KEYBOARD_CUSTOMIZATION
	bool "Support keyboard customization"
	help
	  Enable support for customization keyboard, some boards need to custom matrix
	  because those board keyboard layout doesn't follow a common matrix.

	  If define, the board layer
	  needs to implement:
	  1. the scancode_set2 and keycap_label array
	  2. keyboard_customization.h which is similar to keyboard_config.h

	  Note that if your board has the standard chromeos keyboard layout other
	  than the top row, and you are looking only for top row customization,
	  then you should be looking at overriding board_vivaldi_keybd_config()
	  instead.

config TEST_DISABLE_AP_PWRSEQ
	bool "Disable CONFIG_AP_PWRSEQ"
	default n
	help
	  This is used to disable CONFIG_AP_PWRSEQ for testing purposes
	  directly.
