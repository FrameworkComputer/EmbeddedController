	help
	  Capture PDC messages between the EC and the PDC chip. These
	  can be standard UCSI messages or vendor specific messages such
	  as those defined for the rts54xx chip. Message data is
	  reported in the test run logs and in a separate "rts.pcap"
	  file in PCAP capture file format.

	help
	  No help.

	  These tests are incompatible with TEST_PDC_MESSAGE_TRACING
	  since that config enables an alternate implementation of the
	  code to be tested here.

config TEST_DISABLE_INLINE_CHIPSET_IN_STATE

	  This is used to not define chipset_in_state method as inline
