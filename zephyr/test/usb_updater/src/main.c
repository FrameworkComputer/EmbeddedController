/* This test requires both flash_simulator and CONFIG_MAPPED_STORAGE enabled
 * and synced.
 *
 * MAPPED_STORAGE_BASE must be hard-coded in the config file, but
 * flash_simulator allocates memory at runtime.
 * To solve this, the following code opens the simulated flash file at a
 * hard-coded address (currently 0x800000, this address is currently unused,
 * the test program only uses memory up to ~0x500000).
 *
 * Users can use msync(2) to sync data between flash_simulator and
 * MAPPED_STORAGE if needed.
